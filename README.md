## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.12
- PyTorch
- CUDA (if using GPU)
- LLaMA3

### Installation
   ```
   pip install rag-llama3
   ```

### Configuration

Edit the `config_template.yaml` file under src directory to set your project-specific parameters and paths. 

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract text from raw data sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the extracted text. We provide functions for preprocessing text but did not use them when creating vector embeddings.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Generate embeddings for the preprocessed text using LLaMA3 and store them in a Chroma database.
4. **RAG Pipeline**: Set up and run the RAG pipeline.

## How to Use
There is a [Instruction.ipynb](https://github.com/DNALinux/ai/blob/main/Instruction.ipynb) you can use to test the code.

1. **Configuration**:
   - set up the directory paths for storing your data and Chroma database. It is better to create them manually; but you can also just specify where they should be, and they should be automatically created:
     - `input_dir`: Directory for PDF, HTML files, and URLs.
     - `urls_path`: Path to a file named urls.txt where you put all the urls.
     - `output_dir`: Directory where TextExtractor will store all `.txt` files (for debugging purposes).
     - `chroma_db_dir`: Directory where your Chroma database will be stored.
     - `chroma_db_name`: Collection name for your Chroma database.
   - Note: The embedding model defaults to `'mxbai-embed-large'`. Feel free to choose your preferred Ollama embedding model.
   ```python
   from rag_llama3 import RAG as rag
   from rag_llama3 import TextExtractor as te
   from rag_llama3 import VectorDB as vdb
   # Load configuration, please insert the path to your configuration file.
   config = rag.load_config('/home/tagore/repos/ai/rag_llama3/config_template.yaml')

   # Extract configuration values
   vector_db_config = config.get('vector_db')
   input_dir = vector_db_config.get('input_dir')
   output_dir = vector_db_config.get('output_dir')
   urls_path = vector_db_config.get('urls_path')
   chroma_db_dir = vector_db_config.get('chroma_db_dir')
   chroma_db_name = vector_db_config.get('chroma_db_name')
   model = vector_db_config.get('model')
   ```

2. **Directory Setup**:
   - Open a Jupyter notebook and run the following code to ensure that your directory is created:
     ```python
     test_vector_db = vdb(input_dir, output_dir, urls_path, chroma_db_dir, chroma_db_name)
     ```
   - This will create an object that you can use to manipulate your Chroma vector database. It will automatically create all the directories and an empty Chroma database. If everything is already created, it will not overwrite existing files.

3. **Add Files**:
   - Place all PDF and HTML files in the input directory. List all URLs in the `urls.txt` file, each on a new line.

4. **Load Data**:
   - Use the `test_vector_db` object to load files into the vector database:
     ```python
     test_vector_db.load_data()
     ```
   - Alternatively, load different types of files individually:
     ```python
     test_vector_db.load_url()
     test_vector_db.load_pdf()
     test_vector_db.load_html()
     ```
   - Loading might take some time. After loading, check if the vector database has been populated successfully:
     ```python
     test_vector_db.peek()
     test_vector_db.show_sources()
     ```
   - Query data from a specific source:
     ```python
     test_vector_db.query_sources(source_name)
     ```
   - To delete data from a source:
     ```python
     test_vector_db.delete_source(source_name)
     ```
   - Or to clear the entire database (be cautious as this is destructive):
     ```python
     test_vector_db.clear_database()
     ```

5. **Generate Answers**:
   - In a Jupyter notebook, use:
     ```python
     testRAG = rag(input, output, chroma_db, collection_name)
     print(testRAG.generate_answer("Your question goes here"))
     ```
   - You can also try out our pre-installed DNALinux AI agent by typing in the command line:
     ```bash
     rag-llama3 "your question goes here"
     ```


## Other Class and Function Introduction

### TextExtractor Class

The `TextExtractor` class is designed to handle text extraction from various sources such as PDF files, HTML files, and URLs. This class facilitates the transformation of raw text data into a format suitable for creating vector embeddings and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. It also includes functionality for saving extracted text to files for debugging purposes.

#### Key Functionalities

- **get_pdf**: Returns a list of PDF file paths from the input directory.
- **get_html**: Returns a list of HTML file paths from the input directory.
- **get_urls**: Retrieves URLs from a text file within the input directory.

- **save_text_to_file**: Saves a given text to a specified file for debugging purposes.

- **save_a_pdf_text**: Extracts text from a PDF file and saves each page's text to separate files. It ensures limited overlap between pages and avoids saving pages with only one line of text.
- **save_pdfs_texts**: Extracts text from multiple PDF files and saves each page's text to separate files.
- **extract_pdf_texts**: Extracts text from a PDF file and returns it as a list, ensuring limited overlap between pages and avoiding pages with only one line of text.

- **save_a_html_text**: Extracts text from an HTML file and saves it to multiple files with specified character limits and overlap.
- **save_html_texts**: Extracts text from multiple HTML files and saves them to multiple files.
- **extract_html_text**: Extracts text from an HTML file and returns it as a list of text chunks with specified character limits and overlap.

- **is_relevant_link**: Determines if a link is relevant based on specific heuristics.
- **extract_url_text**: Extracts headings and paragraphs from a URL and returns the text along with relevant links.
- **save_chunks_to_files**: Saves text chunks to files in the specified directory.
- **split_text_into_chunks**: Splits text into chunks with specified overlap.
- **get_main_domain**: Extracts the main domain from a URL.
- **crawl_and_save**: Crawls a website recursively, extracts text, and saves it to files.
- **crawl_and_extract**: Crawls a website recursively, extracts text, and returns it as a list of text chunks.

```python
from rag_llama3 import TextExtractor as te

# Initialize TextExtractor with input and output directories
text_extractor = te(input_dir='path/to/input', output_dir='path/to/output', urls_file = 'path/to/urls.txt')

# Get PDF File Paths
pdf_files = text_extractor.get_pdf()
print(pdf_files)  # List of PDF file paths

#Extract and Save PDF Texts to Files
text_extractor.save_pdfs_texts(pdf_files) 

#Extract PDF Texts to a List
pdf_texts = text_extractor.extract_pdf_texts('path/to/sample.pdf')
print(pdf_texts)  # List of extracted text chunks from the PDF

#The same process applies for HTML and URL
```
### VectorDB Class

The `VectorDB` class manages a Chroma vector database, allowing for the extraction, processing, and storage of text data from various sources, including PDFs, HTML files, and URLs. This class integrates with the `TextExtractor` class for text extraction and uses the Ollama model for generating vector embeddings.

- **delete_source**: Deletes all documents from a specific source.
- **show_sources**: Shows all sources in the vector database.
- **query_sources**: Queries the vector database with a specific source.
- **query**: Queries the vector database with a text prompt.
- **clear_database**: Clears the vector database.


### `RAG` Class Introduction

The `RAG` (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) class provides a comprehensive solution for integrating a vector database with the LLaMA3 model to generate and stream answers based on user queries. It includes functionalities for setting up the vector database, generating prompts, and creating answers with both regular and streaming outputs.

#### Key Functionalities

- **Initialization**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes the `RAG` class, setting up the vector database with specified directories and a default embedding model.
  - `_setup_vector_db`: Checks if the vector database exists and populates it with data if needed.
  - `_is_database_populated`: Verifies if the vector database contains data.

- **Prompt Generation**:
  - `generate_prompt`: Creates a prompt for querying the model, incorporating the user's question and the retrieved context.

- **Answer Generation**:
  - `generate_answer`: Generates an answer using the vector database and the LLaMA3 model.
  - `stream_answer`: Generates an answer with streaming output, providing real-time response chunks.

### `preprocess_text`

The `preprocess_text` function performs a series of text preprocessing steps to clean and standardize raw text. It includes:

- **Lowercasing**: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: Strips out any characters that are not letters, numbers, or whitespace.
- **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Filters out common words that may not contribute meaningful information to the analysis.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base or root form.

This function outputs a preprocessed text string that is ready for further analysis or processing.
