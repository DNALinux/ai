1- What is the word size parameter in BLAST? 
  Word size for sequence alignment algorithms is the minimum number of characters required to seed a match between two sequences.

2- How to get the results of BLASTP in XML format?
  To get BLASTP results in XML, you can use the -outfmt option with the value 5
  Code 
  blastp -query your_query_sequence.fasta -db your_database -out results.xml -outfmt 5

3- How to perform a BLAST on a specific taxonomic group?
  To limit a BLAST search by taxonomy, one needs to provide the NCBI taxonomy ID(s) (taxid) for given taxonomic group(s). A taxid is simply a number that specifies a node in the taxonomic tree.
  1. -taxids with comma-separated list of taxids, or
  2. -taxidlist with a path to a file that contains a list of taxids, one per line. This file must be present in the local file system where ElasticBLAST is run. Cloud storage locations, like s3:// or gs:// will not work.

4- What parameters do I use to perform BLAST with epitopes smaller than 10 amino acids?
  Use blastp-short. Blast-short is optimized for query sequences shorter than 30 residues.

5- Which kind of databases can be searched with BLASTX?
  The “blastx” application translates a nucleotide query in six frames and searches it against a protein database.
