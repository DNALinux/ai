Get NCBI BLAST databases
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: May 16, 2024.
The best way to obtain BLAST databases is to download them from NCBI or cloud providers (currently from 
Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services). These  are the same databases available via the public 
BLAST Web Service ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), are updated regularly, and contain taxonomic information 
built into them. These  can also be a source of biological sequence data (see below).
To download a preformatted NCBI BLAST database, run the update_blastdb.pl program followed by any 
relevant options and the name(s) of the BLAST databases to download. For example:
$ update_blastdb.pl --decompress nr [*]
This  command will download the compressed nr BLAST database from NCBI  to the current working directory 
and decompress it. Any subsequent identical invocations of this script with the same parameters in that 
directory will only download any data if it has a different  time stamp when compared to the data at NCBI.
The update_blastdb.pl script can determine if you are calling it from within a cloud provider and will 
automatically download from the appropriate cloud bucket.
If you would like to see what BLAST databases are available to download, please run:
$ update_blastdb.pl --showall [*]
For more information on available NCBI BLAST databases, please see https://go.usa.gov/xPhky  . For a demo of 
this tool, please see https://bit.ly/2UA7tYb  (external link).
To verify that the BLAST database download was successful, please see How to check BLAST database integrity?
For more details about what command line options this tool supports, please run:
$ update_blastdb.pl --help
If you need FASTA from these BLAST databases, you can obtain it as follows:
$ blastdbcmd -entry all -db nr -out nr.fsa
If you need FASTA for selected sequence(s) from these BLAST databases, you can obtain it as follows (the 
sequence of interest is identified  by the accession u00001 in this example):
$ blastdbcmd -entry u00001 -db nr -out u00001.fsa
[*] If you run into any problems with this invocation, please try the â€“passive option, which is enabled by default 
in BLAST+ 2.8.1 and following. The --decompress option is only needed if the source data comes from NCBI31
