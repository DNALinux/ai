option type default value Description and notes
nmer integer 12 N-mer size to use. Ignored if –legacy is specified
ws_hint integer 28 This  is an optimization hint for makembindex that indicates an expected minimum match 
size in searches that use the index. If n is the value of -nmer parameter and s is the value of –
stride parameter, then the value of -ws_hint must be at least n + s - 1.
stride integer 5 makembindex will index every stride-th N-mer of the database.
volsize integer 1536 Target index volume size in megabytes.
BLASTN reward/penalty values
BLASTN uses a simple approach to score alignments, with identically matching bases assigned a reward and 
mismatching bases assigned a penalty. It is important to choose reward/penalty values appropriate to the 
sequences being aligned with the (absolute) reward/penalty ratio increasing for more divergent sequences. A 
ratio of 0.33 (1/-3) is appropriate for sequences that are about 99% conserved; a ratio of 0.5 (1/-2) is best for 
sequences that are 95% conserved; a ratio of about one (1/-1) is best for sequences that are 75% conserved [ 2].
For each reward/penalty pair, a number of different  gap costs are supported. A gap cost includes a value to open 
the gap and a value to extend the gap by a base. Following the convention of the command-line applications, 
these costs are listed as positive numbers here. MegaBLAST uses a specialized algorithm to calculate the default 
gap costs for a reward/penalty pair that is described in PMID:10890397 . Briefly,  the default megaBLAST cost to 
open a gap is zero and the cost to extend a gap two letters is given by the absolute value of two mismatches 
minus one match. For example, given a reward of 1 and penalty of -5, the cost to extend a gap by one letter is 5.5. 
The default gap costs for other tasks supported by the blastn application is 5 to open a gap and 2 to extend one 
base.
Table D1  presents the supported reward/penalty values and gap costs.
Table D1: Supported reward/penalty values and gap costs for the blastn application. The left-most  column presents the supported 
reward/penalty values. The middle column presents pairs of numbers for the cost to open and extend a gap for each reward/penalty 
value. Blastn also supports gap costs more stringent than those listed (e.g., for reward/penalty of 1/-3 gap costs of 5/2 or 500/2 are 
supported). The reward/penalty values are ordered from most to least stringent, with the more stringent values better suited for 
alignments with high sequence identity. The default megaBLAST gap costs are shown in the right-most column. Accurate statistics for 
these default megaBLAST gap costs can only be calculated for the most stringent reward/penalty values, but the values listed in the 
middle column can always be used.
