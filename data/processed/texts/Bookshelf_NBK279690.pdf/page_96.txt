option type default value description and notes
db_gen_code integer 1 Genetic code to translate subject sequences, see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/
gc.prt
max_intron_length integer 0 Length of the largest intron allowed in a translated nucleotide sequence when linking 
multiple distinct alignments (a negative value disables linking)
Table C7: rpsblast application options. The rpsblast application searches a protein query against the conserved domain database 
(CDD), which is a set of protein profiles.  Many of the common options such as matrix or word threshold are set when the CDD is built 
and cannot be changed by the rpsblast application. A search ready CDD can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/

Option Type Default 
valueDescription and notes
window_size integer 40 Multiple hits window size, use 0 to specify 1-hit algorithm.
xdrop_ungap real 15 Heuristic value (in bits) for ungapped extensions
xdrop_gap real 25 Heuristic value (in bits) for preliminary gapped extensions.
xdrop_gap_final real 40 Heuristic value (in bits) for final  gapped alignment.
seg string 12 2.2 2.5 Filter query sequence with SEG (Format: 'yes', 'window locut hicut', or 'no' to disable).
soft_masking boolean false Apply filtering  locations as soft masks (i.e., only for finding  initial matches).
mt_mode integer 0 Set to 1 if a large number of queries are to be searched and you wish to use multiple 
threads, as specified  by the num_threads argument.
comp_based_stats integer 2 Use composition-based statistics for rpsblast:
D or d: default (equivalent to 2)
0 or F or f: no composition-based statistics
1: Composition-based statistics as in NAR 29:2994-3005, 2001
2 or T or t : Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics
21:902-911, 2005, conditioned on sequence properties
3: Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics 21:902-911, 2005, 
unconditionally
Default = `2'
Table C8: Makeblastdb application options. This  application builds a BLAST database. An option of type “flag”  takes no arguments, but 
if present the argument is true. Starting with the 2.10.0 release, makeblastdb produces version 5 databases by default, which uses 
LMDB. LMDB requires virtual memory (at least 600 GB, but 800 GB is recommended) to build an index. If makeblastdb cannot access 
enough virtual memory, it will produce a message containing the string “mdb_env_open” . Virtual memory is just that (virtual) and 
doesn’t depend on the hardware in your system. In general, we recommend that BLAST users simply set the virtual memory to 
unlimited. The other alternative is to use an environment variable (BLASTDB_LMDB_MAP_SIZE) to set the required virtual memory 
lower, but this runs the risk of LMDB not being able to complete indexing the database. For a smaller database (tens of millions of 
letters) it may be possible to use a value of 100 million.
