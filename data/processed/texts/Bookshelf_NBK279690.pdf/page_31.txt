Configuring BLAST

The BLAST+ search applications can be configured  by means of a configuration  file or environment variables.
Configuring BLAST via configuration file
This  can be accomplished with a configuration  file named .ncbirc (on Unix-like platforms) or ncbi.ini (on 
Windows). This  is a plain text file that contains sections and key-value pairs to specify configuration  parameters. 
Lines starting with a semi-colon are considered comments. The application will search for the file in the 
following order and locations:
1.Current working directory (*)
2.User's HOME directory (*)
3.Directory specified  by the NCBI environment variable
4.The standard system directory (“/etc” on Unix-like systems, and given by the environment variable 
SYSTEMROOT on Windows)
(*) Unless the NCBI_DONT_USE_LOCAL_CONFIG environment variable is defined.
The search for this file will stop at the first location where it is found and the configurations  settings from that 
file will be applied. If the configuration  file is not found or if the NCBI_DONT_USE_NCBIRC environment 
variable is defined,  the default values will apply. The following are the possible configuration  parameters that 
impact the BLAST+ applications:
Configuration  Parameter Specifies Default value
BLASTDB Path to BLAST databases. Current working 
directory
DATA_LOADERS Data loaders to use for automatic sequence identifier  resolution. 
This  is a comma separated list of the following keywords: blastdb, 
genbank, and none. The none keyword disables this feature and 
takes precedence over any other keywords specified.blastdb,genbank
BLASTDB_PROT_DATA_LOADER Locally available BLAST database name to search when resolving 
protein sequences using BLAST databases. Ignored if 
DATA_LOADERS does not include the blastdb keyword.nr
BLASTDB_NUCL_DATA_LOADER Locally available BLAST database name to search when resolving 
nucleotide sequences using BLAST databases. Ignored if 
DATA_LOADERS does not include the blastdb keyword.nt
BLAST_USAGE_REPORT Specifies  whether or not usage information should be returned to 
the NCBI. Set this value to false to disable this feature.true
