Specifying a sequence as the multiple sequence alignment 
master in psiblast
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
The -in_msa psiblast option, unlike blastpgp, does not support the specification  of a master sequence via the 
-query option, so if one wants to specify a sequence (other than the first one) in the multiple sequence alignment 
file to be the master sequence, this has to be specified  via the -msa_master_idx option. For instance, in the 
example below, the third sequence in the multiple sequence alignment would be used as the master sequence:
psiblast -in_msa align1 -db pataa -msa_master_idx 3 59
