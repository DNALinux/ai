Improved software installation packages
The BLAST+ applications are available via Windows and MacOSX installers as well as RPMs (source and binary) 
and unix tarballs. For more details about these, refer to the installation  section.
Sequence filtering applications
The BLAST+ applications include a new set of sequence filtering  applications, namely segmasker, dustmasker, 
and windowmasker. Segmasker is an application that identifies  and masks low complexity regions of protein 
sequences. The dustmasker application provides a similar functionality for nucleotide sequences. 
Windowmasker uses a genome to identify sequences represented too often  to be of interest to most users. See 
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/dustmasker/README.dustmasker  and ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/
agarwala/windowmasker/README.windowmasker  for more information.
Best-Hits filtering algorithm
The Best-Hit filtering  algorithm is designed for use in applications that are searching for only the best matches 
for each query region reporting matches. Its -best_hit_overhang parameter, H, controls when an HSP is 
considered short enough to be filtered  due to presence of another HSP . For each HSP A that is filtered,  there 
exists another HSP B such that the query region of HSP A extends each end of the query region of HSP B by at 
most H times the length of the query region for B.
Additional requirements that must also be met in order to filter  A on account of B are:
i. evalue(A) >= evalue(B)
ii. score(A)/length(A) < (1.0 â€“ score_edge) * score(B)/length(B)
We consider 0.1 to 0.25 to be an acceptable range for the -best_hit_overhang parameter and 0.05 to 0.25 to be an 
acceptable range for the -best_hit_score_edge parameter. Increasing the value of the overhang parameter 
eliminates a higher number of matches, but increases the running time; increasing the score_edge parameter 
removes smaller number of hits.
Automatic resolution of sequence identifiers
The BLAST+ search applications support automatic resolution of query and subject sequence identifiers  
specified  as GIs or accessions (see the cookbook section for an example). This  feature enables the user to specify 
one or more sequence identifiers  (GIs and/or accessions, one per line) in a file as the input to the -query and 
-subject command line options.
Upon encountering this type of input, by default the BLAST+ search applications will try to resolve these 
sequence identifiers  in locally available BLAST databases first,  then in the BLAST databases at NCBI, and finally  
in Genbank (the latter two data sources require a properly configured  internet connection). These  data sources 
can be configured  via the DATA_LOADERS configuration  option and the BLAST databases to search can be 
configured  via the BLASTDB_PROT_DATA_LOADER and BLASTDB_NUCL_DATA_LOADER configuration  
options (see the section on Configuring  BLAST ).
BLAST-WindowMasker integration in BLAST+ search applications
The BLAST+ search applications support integration with the windowmasker files via the 
-window_masker_taxid and the WINDOW_MASKER_PATH configuration  parameter (see Configuring  
BLAST ) or via the -window_masker_db command line option.BLAST+ features 19
