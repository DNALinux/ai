Ignoring the consensus sequence in the multiple sequence 
alignment in psiblast
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
Often  a consensus sequence is added to a multiple sequence alignment to be used as the master sequence in a 
PSI-BLAST search. The consensus sequence provides a good option to display the query-subject alignment in 
the output and to define  which MSA columns are to be converted to PSSM. At the same time adding the 
consensus sequence changes the statistical properties of the original alignment. To avoid this, the 
-ignore_msa_master option can be used:
psiblast -in_msa align1 -db pataa -ignore_msa_master 
In this case the master sequence is displayed in the output but ignored when the PSSM scores are calculated.61
