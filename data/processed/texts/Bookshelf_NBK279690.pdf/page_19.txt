Privacy Statement
As part of our effort  to improve BLAST+, we have implemented usage reporting to collect limited data. This 
information shows us whether BLAST+ is being used by the community, and therefore is worth being 
maintained and developed by NCBI. It also allows us to focus our development efforts  on the most used aspects 
of BLAST+. If possible, please report your usage, so we can continue to support and develop BLAST+ to best suit 
your needs.
Y ou can easily opt-out of sending information about your searches if you wish by following the instructions 
below . This  offers  you greater privacy control than sending searches over the internet using web tools or the 
-remote option on a BLAST+ executable, which also accesses the web service.
Information sent back to NCBI is limited to the name of the BLAST program, database metadata, a few BLAST 
parameters, as well the number and total size of your queries without any data association that might reveal the 
context of your research. No sequences from your queries or database are sent to the NCBI. An example set of 
data from a BLAST search is provided below. More information about each item is shown in the table following 
the list.
