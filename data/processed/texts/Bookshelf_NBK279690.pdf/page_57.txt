Use Windowmasker to filter the query sequence(s) in a BLAST 
search
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
The blastn executable can filter  a query sequence using the windowmasker data files.  This  option can be used to 
mask interspersed repeats that may lead to spurious matches. The windowmasker data files should be created as 
discussed in step 1 of “ Create masking information using windowmasker ” or downloaded from the NCBI FTP 
site. Follow the instructions in Configuring  BLAST  to make sure BLAST will be able to find the windowmasker 
files in the examples below.
1. Run BLAST search using Windowmasker for sequence filtering based upon taxid 
(9606 is the taxid for human).
$ blastn -query input -db database -window_masker_taxid 9606 -out results.txt
2. Run BLAST search using Windowmasker for sequence filtering based upon the windowmasker 
file name.
$ blastn –query input –db database –window_masker_db 9606/wmasker.obinary49
