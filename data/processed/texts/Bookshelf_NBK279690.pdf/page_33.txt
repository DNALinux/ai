BLAST_USAGE_REPORT Specifies  whether or not usage information should be returned to the NCBI. Set this variable 
to false to disable this feature.
Controlling concatenation of queries
As described above, BLAST+ works more efficiently  if it scans the database once for multiple queries. This 
feature is knows as concatenation. Unfortunately, for some searches the concatenation values are not optimal, 
too many queries are searched at once, and the process can consume too much memory. For applications besides 
BLASTN (which uses an adaptive approach), it is possible to control these values by setting the BATCH_SIZE 
environment variable. Setting the value too low will degrade performance dramatically, so this environment 
variable should be used with caution.
Memory usage
The BLAST search programs can exhaust all memory on a machine if the input is too large or if there are too 
many hits to the BLAST database. If this is the case, please see your operating system documentation to limit the 
memory used by a program (e.g.: ulimit on Unix-like platforms). Setting the BATCH_SIZE environment 
variable as described above may help.Configuring  BLAST 25
