option task type default value description and notes
comp_based_stats all string 2 Use composition-based statistics for tblastn:
D or d: default (equivalent to 2)
0 or F or f: no composition-based statistics
1: Composition-based statistics as in NAR 29:2994-3005, 2001
2 or T or t : Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics
21:902-911, 2005, conditioned on sequence properties
3: Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics 21:902-911, 
2005, unconditionally
Default = `2'
Table C6: tblastx application options. The tblastx application searches a translated nucleotide query against translated nucleotide 
subject sequences or a translated nucleotide database. An option of type “flag”  takes no arguments, but if present the argument is true. 
This  table reflects  the 2.2.27 BLAST+ release. Only ungapped searches are supported for tblastx.
option type default value description and notes
word_size integer 3 Word size for initial match.
matrix string BLOSUM62 Scoring matrix name.
threshold integer 13 Minimum word score to add the word to the BLAST lookup table.
seg string 12 2.2 2.5 Filter query sequence with SEG (Format: 'yes', 'window locut hicut', or 'no' to disable).
soft_masking boolean false Apply filtering  locations as soft masks (i.e., only for finding  initial matches).
lcase_masking flag N/A Use lower case filtering  in query and subject sequence(s).
db_soft_mask integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as soft mask (i.e., only for finding  
initial matches).
db_hard_mask integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as hard mask (i.e., sequence is 
masked for all phases of search).
strand string both Query strand(s) to search against database subject sequences. Choice of both, minus, or 
plus.
query_genetic_code integer 1 Genetic code to translate query, see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/gc.prtAppendices 87
