Clean-up unused database volumes
Created: June 30, 2023; Updated: June 30, 2023.
The script cleanup-blastdb-volumes.py can be used to remove unused BLAST database volumes that may go 
unnoticed and take up space. There  are two main ways that this may occur:
•The number of volumes in a BLAST database grew larger than 100, and the volumes have three digits 
rather than two (e.g., nr.02 becomes nr.002)
•The number of volumes in a BLAST database was reduced. This  may happen if enough sequences are 
removed from the database or if the database was recreated with a larger maximum volume size (e.g.: via 
makeblastdb 's -max_file_sz  command line option).
Y ou may invoke the script with a simple command. For example, to remove unneeded volumes of nt, use the 
command below. For other databases, simply replace nt by the name of the database. For protein databases, 
replace “nucl” by “prot” .
$ cleanup-blastdb-volumes.py -db nt -dbtype nucl
cleanup-blastdb-volumes.py is included in the BLAST+ release.71
