Performing a DELTA-BLAST search
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
DELTA-BLAST searches a protein sequence database using a PSSM constructed from conserved domains 
matching a query. It first searches the NCBI CDD database to construct the PSSM.
Download the cdd_delta database
Obtain this database from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db  using the update_blastdb.pl  tool (provided as part 
of the BLAST+ package). Note that the cdd_delta database must be downloaded and installed to the standard 
BLAST database directory (see Configuring  BLAST ) or in the current working directory.
Execute the deltablast search
$ deltablast –query query.fsa –db pataa
Indexed megaBLAST search
The indexed megaBLAST search requires both BLAST databases as well as an index of the words found in the 
database. The index of words may be produced with makembindex. The example below demonstrates how to 
produce the index as well as perform an indexed megaBLAST search. This  example assumes that the nt.00 
BLAST database has been placed in the current directory (before makembindex is run) and that QUERY is a file 
containing a nucleotide query. Results will appear in OUTPUT. See tables C2 and C11 for information on 
command-line options.
$ makembindex -input nt.00 -iformat blastdb -old_style_index false
$ blastn -db ./nt.00 -query QUERY -use_index true –out OUTPUT
 
The BLAST databases may contain filtering  (or masking) information for the database sequences. Makembindex 
can access this information and exclude the masked regions of the database from the index. This  is demonstrated 
below. The first command shows how to discover the masking “ Algorithm ID” from the BLAST database using 
blastdbcmd. In this case, the ID is 30. The second command demonstrates how to build an index that excludes 
the masked regions. Once the index has been built, it can be used as shown above. In the example below, the 
ref_contig BLAST database had been placed in the directory before makembindex was run.
$ blastdbcmd -db ref_contig -info
