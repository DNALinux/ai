Created: May 16, 2024.
The blastdbcheck application can validate the integrity of a BLAST database. This  may be helpful to do after  you 
have downloaded a BLAST database. For instance, to validate the protein swissprot database, run the command:
$ blastdbcheck -db swissprot -dbtype prot
If the application reports any errors, please check that there is enough disk space available to store the BLAST 
database and/or try again.73
