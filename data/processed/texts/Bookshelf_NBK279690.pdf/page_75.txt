Faster sequence lookups by accession
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
Starting with BLASTDB version 5, blastdbcmd has two additional parameters (-taxids and -taxidlists) to 
efficiently  retrieve sequences by taxid.
# Retrieves all human entries; 
# %a prints the accession, %T prints the taxid, %S prints the scientific name
$ blastdbcmd -db nr -taxids 9606 -outfmt “%a %T %S” -target_only 
Note: -target_only is used to ensure that only accessions for the human entries are present. Otherwise, it will 
present all accessions on any sequence with at least one human sequence. This  is important since nr is a non-
redundant database.67
