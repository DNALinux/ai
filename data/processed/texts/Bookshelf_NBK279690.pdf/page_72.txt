BLAST+ remote service
The BLAST+ applications can perform a search on the NCBI servers if invoked with the “–remote” flag. All other 
command-line options are the same as for a stand-alone search.
The box below shows an example BLAST+ remote search using the blastn application. First, blastn searches the 
query against the nt database and produces a standard BLAST report. The query file (nt.u00001) contains the 
sequence for accession u00001 as FASTA. Second, the UNIX grep utility is used to find the RID for the search. 
Note that the RID can simply be found near the top of the BLAST report. Third,  the RID is then used with 
blast_formatter to print out the results as a tabular report. Finally, the results are formatted as XML. The RID is 
only printed as an example and is no longer valid.
$ blastn –db nt –query nt.u00001 –out test.out -remote
$ grep RID test.out
RID: X3R7GAUS014
$blast_formatter –rid X3R7GAUS014 –out test.tab –outfmt 7 
$blast_formatter –rid X3R7GAUS014 –out test.xml –outfmt 5 64 BLAST® Command Line Applications User Manual
