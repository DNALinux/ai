The functionality offered  by the BLAST+ applications has been organized by program type, as to more closely 
resemble Web BLAST.
As an example, to run a search of a nucleotide query (translated “on the fly” by BLAST) against a protein 
database one would use the blastx application. The blastx application will also work in “Blast2Sequences” mode 
(i.e.: accept FASTA sequences instead of a BLAST database as targets) and can also send BLAST searches over 
the network to the public NCBI server if desired.
The BLAST+ package offers  three categories of applications: 1.) search tools, 2.) BLAST database tools, and 3.) 
sequence filtering  tools. The blastn, blastp, blastx, tblastx, tblastn, psiblast, rpsblast, and rpstblastn are considered 
search applications, as they execute a BLAST search, whereas makeblastdb, blastdb_aliastool, makeprofiledb,  and 
blastdbcmd are considered BLAST database applications, as they either create or examine BLAST databases.
There  is also a new set of sequence filtering  applications described in the section Sequence filtering  applications 
and an application to build database indices that greatly speed up megablast in some cases (see section titled 
Megablast indexed searches ).
