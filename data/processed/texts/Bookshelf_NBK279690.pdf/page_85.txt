Table C1 continued from previous page.
option type default value description and notes
subject string none File with subject sequence(s) to search.
subject_loc string none Location on the subject sequence (Format: start-stop).
show_gis flag N/A Show NCBI GIs in report.
num_descriptions integer 500 Show one-line descriptions for this number of database sequences.
num_alignments integer 250 Show alignments for this number of database sequences.
max_target_seqs integer 500 Number of aligned sequences to keep. Use with report formats that do not have 
separate definition  line and alignment sections such as tabular (all outfmt > 4). Not 
compatible with num_descriptions or num_alignments. Ties are broken by order of 
sequences in the database.
max_hsps integer none Maximum number of HSPs (alignments) to keep for any single query-subject pair. 
The HSPs shown will be the best as judged by expect value. This  number should be an 
integer that is one or greater. If this option is not set, BLAST shows all HSPs meeting 
the expect value criteria. Setting it to one will show only the best HSP for every 
query-subject pair
html flag N/A Produce HTML output
gilist string none Restrict search of database to GI’s listed in this file. Local searches only.
negative_gilist string none Restrict search of database to everything except the GI’s listed in this file. Local 
searches only.
entrez_query string none Restrict search with the given Entrez query. Remote searches only.
culling_limit integer none Delete a hit that is enveloped by at least this many higher-scoring hits.
best_hit_overhang real none Best Hit algorithm overhang value (recommended value: 0.1)
best_hit_score_edge real none Best Hit algorithm score edge value (recommended value: 0.1)
dbsize integer none Effective  size of the database
searchsp integer none Effective  length of the search spaceAppendices 77
