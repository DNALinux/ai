BLAST database metadata
Starting from BLAST+ 2.13.0, makeblastdb generates an additional file with the file extension .njs (for nucleotide 
databases) or .pjs (for protein databases) which contains BLAST database metadata in JSON format. This  file can 
be easily read by many tools and makes the BLAST database more Findable in the FAIR sense. Here is an 
example:
{
  "version": "1.2",
  "dbname": "protein-ecoli",
  "dbtype": "Protein",
  "db-version": 5,
  "description": "Escherichia coli protein sequences",
  "number-of-letters": 1358990,
  "number-of-sequences": 4289,
  "last-updated": "2022-03-09T13:39:00",
  "number-of-volumes": 1,
  "bytes-total": 2412774,
  "bytes-to-cache": 1397688,
  "files": [
    "protein-ecoli.pdb",
    "protein-ecoli.phr",
    "protein-ecoli.pin",
    "protein-ecoli.pnd",
    "protein-ecoli.pni",
    "protein-ecoli.pog",
    "protein-ecoli.pos",
    "protein-ecoli.pot",
    "protein-ecoli.psq",
    "protein-ecoli.ptf",
    "protein-ecoli.pto"
  ]
}
The fields  represent the following:
Field Description
version Version of the BLASTDB metadata format
dbname BLAST database base name
dbtype Molecule type of the BLAST database
db-version BLAST database version
description Description of the BLAST database contents (i.e.: BLAST database title)
number-of-letters Number of bases/residues in the BLAST database
number-of-sequences Number of sequences in the BLAST database
last-updated Date when this BLAST database was created
number-of-volumes Number of BLAST database volumes that makes up this BLAST database
bytes-total Number of bytes that comprise this BLAST database
bytes-to-cache Number of bytes required to cache this BLAST database in main memory (RAM) for optimal performance
