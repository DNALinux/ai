Conversion from C toolkit applications
The functionality offered  by the BLAST+ applications has been organized by program type. The following graph 
depicts a correspondence between the NCBI C Toolkit BLAST command line applications and the BLAST+ 
applications:
The easiest way to get started using the BLAST+ command line applications is by means of the legacy_blast.pl 
PERL script which is bundled along with the BLAST+ applications. To utilize this script, simply prefix  it to the 
invocation of the C toolkit BLAST command line application and append the --path option pointing to the 
installation directory of the BLAST+ applications. For example, instead of using
    blastall -i query -d nr -o blast.out 
use
    legacy_blast.pl blastall -i query -d nr -o blast.out 
--path /opt/blast/bin 
The purpose of the legacy_blast.pl PERL script is to help users make the transition from the C Toolkit BLAST 
command line applications to the BLAST+ applications. This  script produces its own documentation by 
invoking it without any arguments.
The legacy_blast.pl script supports two modes of operation, one in which the C Toolkit BLAST command line 
invocation is converted and executed on behalf of the user and another which solely displays the BLAST+ 
application equivalent to what was provided, without executing the command.
The first mode of operation is achieved by specifying the C Toolkit BLAST command line application invocation 
and optionally providing the --path argument after  the command line to convert if the installation path for the 
BLAST+ applications differs  from the default (available by invoking the script without arguments). See example 
in the first section of the Quick start.
The second mode of operation is achieved by specifying the C Toolkit BLAST command line application 
invocation and appending the --print_only command line option as follows:
$ ./legacy_blast.pl megablast -i query.fsa -d nt -o mb.out --print_only
/opt/ncbi/blast/bin/blastn -query query.fsa -db "nt" -out mb.out 
$ 
Exit codes
All BLAST+ applications have consistent exit codes to signify the exit status of the application. The possible exit 
codes along with their meaning are detailed in the table below:75
