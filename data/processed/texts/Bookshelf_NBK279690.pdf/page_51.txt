Use blastdb_aliastool to manage the BLAST databases
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
Often,  one needs to search multiple databases together or wishes to search a specific  subset of sequences within 
an existing database. For these type of searches a convenient way to conduct them is by creating a virtual BLAST 
database. The blastdb_aliastool can perform three types of tasks to assist in that process. First, it can build an 
alias file to transparently combine searches of different  databases. Second, it can build an alias file that limits a 
search based on a list of GIs (numerical IDs) or accessions. Finally, it can convert the list of GI’s or accessions to a 
more efficient  binary format.
Note: When combining BLAST databases, all the databases must be of the same molecule type. The following 
examples assume that the two databases as well as the GI file are in the current working directory. The binary 
format for accessions is only supported in the newer version 5 of the BLAST databases (BLAST+ 2.10.0 or newer 
suggested). Version 5 of the BLAST databases supports limiting a search natively by taxonomy, and only the 
relevant TAXIDs are needed.
Aggregate existing BLAST databases
To combine the two nematode nucleotide databases, named “nematode_mrna” and “nematode_genomic", we 
use the following command line:
$ blastdb_aliastool -dblist "nematode_mrna nematode_genomic" -dbtype nucl \
  -out nematode_all -title "Nematode RefSeq mRNA + Genomic" 
Create a subset of a BLAST database
The nematode_mrna database contains RefSeq mRNAs for several species of round worms. The best subset is 
from C. elegans. In most cases, we want to search this subset instead of the complete collection. Since the 
database entries are from NCBI nucleotide databases and the database is formatted with ”-parse_seqids” , we can 
use the “-gilist c_elegans_mrna.gi” parameter/value pair to limit the search to the subset of interest, alternatively, 
we can create a subset of the nematode_mrna database as follows:
$ blastdb_aliastool -db nematode_mrna -gilist c_elegans_mrna.gi -dbtype \
  nucl -out c_elegans_mrna -title "C. elegans refseq mRNA entries"
Note: one can also specify multiple databases using the -db parameter of blastdb_aliastool.
Convert a GI or accession list to binary format
The blastdb_aliastool can convert a GI or accession list to a binary format that is more efficient  during the 
BLAST search. The example below converts a list of accessions to the binary format. The last two options shown 
(-seqid_db and -seqid_dbtype) are optional and limit the contents of the resulting accession list to accessions in 
the specified  database, in this case swissprot. This  may result in a much smaller file and shorter run times, but 
BLAST will exit with an error if the specified  database is not used. As mentioned earlier, binary accession lists 
are only supported with version 5 BLAST databases.
$ blastdb_aliastool -seqid_file_in myacc.acc -seqid_file_out myacc.bin.acc -seqid_db 
swissprot -seqid_dbtype prot43
