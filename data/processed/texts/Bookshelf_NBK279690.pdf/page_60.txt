Makeblastdb can be invoked for the FASTA and (optional) taxid mapping files as below. We use the 
-blastdb_version parameter to construct a version 5 database and the -taxid_map parameter to associate each 
sequence with a taxonomic node. Note that we also use -parse_seqids.

If you do add the taxids to your database, make sure you have the BLAST taxonomy data files (taxdb.bt[di]) 
which are available from https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/  but also packaged with most BLAST databases 
distributed by the NCBI.
If all of the sequences in your database have the same taxid, you can simply use the -taxid flag on makeblastdb to 
associate all sequences with that taxid rather than needing to prepare a file.
For releases prior to BLAST+ 2.9.0, ad hoc identifiers  (as shown in our example above) should be prefixed  with 
“lcl|” (e.g., lcl|seq1 in place of seq1) for the taxid mapping file.
The NCBI makes databases that are searchable on the NCBI web site (such as nr, refseq_rna, and swissprot) 
available on its FTP site. It is better to download the preformatted databases rather than starting with FASTA. 
The databases on the FTP site contain taxonomic information for each sequence, include the identifier  indices 
for lookups, and can be up to four times smaller than the FASTA. The original FASTA can be generated from the 
BLAST database using blastdbcmd.
Starting with the 2.10.0 release, makeblastdb produces version 5 databases by default, which uses LMDB. LMDB 
requires virtual memory (at least 600 GB, but 800 GB is recommended). Virtual memory is just that (virtual) 
and doesn’t depend on the hardware in your system. In general, we recommend that BLAST users simply set the 
virtual memory to unlimited.52 BLAST® Command Line Applications User Manual
