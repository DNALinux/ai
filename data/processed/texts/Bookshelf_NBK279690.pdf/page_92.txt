db_soft_mask all integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as soft mask 
(i.e., only for finding  initial matches).
db_hard_mask all integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as hard mask 
(i.e., sequence is masked for all phases of search).
xdrop_gap_final all real 25 Heuristic value (in bits) for final  gapped alignment/
window_size Blastp and blastp-
fastinteger 40 Multiple hits window size, use 0 to specify 1-hit algorithm.
window_size blastp-short integer 15 Multiple hits window size, use 0 to specify 1-hit algorithm.
use_sw_tback all flag N/A Compute locally optimal Smith-Waterman alignments?
Table C4: blastx application options. The blastx application translates a nucleotide query and searches it against protein subject 
sequences or a protein database. Two different  tasks are supported: 1.) “blastx” for standard translated nucleotide-protein comparison 
and 2.) “blastx-fast” , a faster version that uses a larger word-size based on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17921491 .
