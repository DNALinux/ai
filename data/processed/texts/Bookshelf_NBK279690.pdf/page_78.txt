BLASTP search of 19,338 human proteins from the refseq_select protein database against swissprot. The top 
(red) line is ThreadByDatabase,  and the bottom (blue) line is ThreadbyQuery.  For 32 threads, the search is 2.2 
times faster (11 minutes vs 24 minutes) with ThreadingByQuery.  The task blastp-fast was used.
Though  this is not recommended, you may override the automatic selection by BLAST with the -mt_mode. Use 
one as a value for ThreadByQuery  and 2 for ThreadByDatabase.  The default value for the -mt_mode option is 0, 
which means BLAST selects a method for you. Y ou can specify the number of threads with the “-num_threads” 
option. See the command line example below.
$ blastp –db swissprot -query BIGFASTA.fsa –out test.out -num_threads 32 -mt_mode 1
To run ThreadByQuery  well, the query file should be above a minimum size and the database below a maximum 
size. Minimum sizes (in bytes) for FASTA query files and maximum database sizes (bases or residues) are listed 
in the table below. Both criteria must be satisfied  for BLAST to run a search with ThreadByQuery.  We 
established the values in this table through a large number of experiments and have found them to be reliable in 
almost all cases.
