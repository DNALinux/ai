Options for the command-line applications.
This  appendix consists of several tables that list option names, types, default values, and a short description of 
the option. These  tables were first published as an appendix to an article in BMC Bioinformatics ( BLAST+: 
architecture and applications ). They  have been updated for this manual.
Table C1: Options common to all BLAST+ search applications. An option of type “flag”  takes no argument, but if present is true. Some 
options are valid only for a local search (“remote” option not used), others are valid only for a remote search (“remote” option used).
