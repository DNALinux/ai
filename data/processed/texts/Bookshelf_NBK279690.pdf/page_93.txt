option task type default value description and notes
db_soft_mask all integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as soft mask (i.e., 
only for finding  initial matches).
db_hard_mask all integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as hard mask (i.e., 
sequence is masked for all phases of search).
xdrop_gap_final all real 25 Heuristic value (in bits) for final  gapped alignment.
window_size all integer 40 Multiple hits window size, use 0 to specify 1-hit algorithm.
strand all string both Query strand(s) to search against database/subject. Choice of both, minus, 
or plus.
query_genetic_code all integer 1 Genetic code to translate query, see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/misc/data/
gc.prt
max_intron_length all integer 0 Length of the largest intron allowed in a translated nucleotide sequence 
when linking multiple distinct alignments (a negative value disables 
linking).
comp_based_stats all integer 2 Use composition-based statistics for blastx:
D or d: default (equivalent to 2)
0 or F or f: no composition-based statistics
1: Composition-based statistics as in NAR 29:2994-3005, 2001
2 or T or t : Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics
21:902-911, 2005, conditioned on sequence properties
3: Composition-based score adjustment as in Bioinformatics 21:902-911, 
2005, unconditionally
Default = `2'
Table C5: tblastn application options. The tblastn application searches a protein query against nucleotide subject sequences or a 
nucleotide database translated at search time. Two different  tasks are supported: 1.) “tblastn” for a standard protein-translated 
nucleotide comparison and 2.) “tblastn-fast” for a faster version with a larger word-size based on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
pubmed/17921491 .

word_size tblastn integer 3 Word size for initial match. Valid word sizes are 2-7.
Word size tblastn-fast Integer 6 Word size for initial match.Appendices 85
