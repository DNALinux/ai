scores, but with infinite  gap costs [ 8]. This  ratio indicates what proportion of information in an ungapped 
alignment must be sacrificed  in the hope of improving its score through extension using gaps. We have found 
empirically that the most effective  gap costs tend to be those with lambda ratios in the range 0.8 to 0.9.

Outline of the BLAST process
Introduction
BLAST performs several steps as it searches through a database and winnows the matches, finding  the most 
significant  matches that it finally  presents to the user. The initial step in this process is the fastest and examines 
every sequence. Each successive step takes longer but examines fewer sequences. The outline below provides 
details on the process and a figure  provides a visual representation. This  outline applies only to gapped BLAST. A 
letter and number in the figure  (e.g., C3) refers to a step in the outline. BLAST is described in greater detail in 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9254694 .
Outline
A.Read in user query and preprocess (mask for low-complexity, etc.)
B.Read user options and set parameters for the search. This  includes examining how many matches 
(database sequences) the user wants returned and the expect value. If the user wants N database 
sequences returned and sets an expect value of E, then:
1.For Composition-based statistics (CBS), set an (internal) maximum limit of N_i=2*N+50 
database sequences and an internal expect value of E_i = 5*E. CBS applies only to protein-protein 
comparisons and is available for BLASTP , BLASTX, TBLASTN, RPSBLAST, and RPSTBLASTN.
2.Otherwise, set a maximum limit of N_i=MAX(MIN(2*N, N+50),10) database sequences.
C.Loop over every sequence in the database, performing the following actions:
1.Scan for initial matching word hits. If an initial hit is found, then move on to step 2, otherwise 
move on to next sequence. Example initial matching word hits are:
