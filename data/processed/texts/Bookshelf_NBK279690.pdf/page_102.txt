BLAST Substitution Matrices
BLAST uses a substitution matrix for any program that aligns residues. The program may align residues because 
both the query and database consist of proteins (e.g. BLASTP) or the program may align DNA translated to 
protein with protein (e.g. BLASTX). A key element in evaluating the quality of a pairwise sequence alignment is 
the "substitution matrix", which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. The theory of amino 
acid substitution matrices is described in [ 1], and applied to DNA sequence comparison in [ 2]. In general, 
different  substitution matrices are tailored to detecting similarities among sequences that are diverged by 
differing  degrees [ 1-3]. A single matrix may nevertheless be reasonably efficient  over a relatively broad range of 
evolutionary change [ 1-3]. Experimentation has shown that the BLOSUM-62 matrix [ 4] is among the best for 
detecting most weak protein similarities. For particularly long and weak alignments, the BLOSUM-45 matrix 
may prove superior. A detailed statistical theory for gapped alignments has not been developed, and the best gap 
costs to use with a given substitution matrix are determined empirically. Short alignments need to be relatively 
strong (i.e. have a higher percentage of matching residues) to rise above background noise. Such short but strong 
alignments are more easily detected using a matrix with a higher "relative entropy" [ 1] than that of BLOSUM-62. 
In particular, short query sequences can only produce short alignments, and therefore database searches with 
short queries should use an appropriately tailored matrix. The BLOSUM series does not include any matrices 
with relative entropies suitable for the shortest queries, so the older PAM matrices [ 5,6] may be used instead. For 
proteins, a provisional table of recommended substitution matrices and gap costs for various query lengths is:
Query Length Substitution Matrix Gap Costs
<35 PAM-30 (9, 1)
35-50 PAM-70 (10, 1)
50-85 BLOSUM-80 (10, 1)
>85 BLOSUM-62 (11, 1)
Gap Costs
The raw score of an alignment is the sum of the scores for aligning pairs of residues and the scores for gaps. 
Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST use "affine  gap costs" which charge the score -a for the existence of a gap, and 
the score -b for each residue in the gap. Thus  a gap of k residues receives a total score of -(a+bk); specifically,  a 
gap of length 1 receives the score -(a+b).
Lambda Ratio
To convert a raw score S into a normalized score S' expressed in bits, one uses the formula S' = (lambda*S - ln 
K)/(ln 2), where lambda and K are parameters dependent upon the scoring system (substitution matrix and gap 
costs) employed [ 7-9]. For determining S', the more important of these parameters is lambda. The "lambda ratio" 
quoted here is the ratio of the lambda for the given scoring system to that for one using the same substitution 94 BLASTÂ® Command Line Applications User Manual
