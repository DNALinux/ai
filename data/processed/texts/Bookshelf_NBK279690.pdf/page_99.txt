Table C10: Blastdbcmd application options. This  application reads a BLAST database and produces reports.
option type default value description and notes
db string nr BLAST database name.
dbtype string guess Molecule type stored in BLAST database, one of nucl, prot, or guess.
entry string none Comma-delimited search string(s) of sequence identifiers:  e.g.: 555, AC147927, 'gnl|
dbname|tag', or 'all' to select all sequences in the database
entry_batch string none Input file for batch processing. The format requires one entry per line; each line should 
begin with the sequence ID followed by any of the following optional specifiers  (in any 
order): range (format: ‘from-to’ , inclusive in 1-offsets),  strand (‘plus’ or ‘minus’), or 
masking algorithm ID (integer value representing the available masking algorithm). 
Omitting the ending range (e.g.: ‘10-‘) is supported, but there should not be any spaces 
around the ‘-‘.
pig integer none PIG (protein identity group) to retrieve.
info flag N/A Print BLAST database information.
range string none Range of sequence to extract (Format: start-stop).
strand string plus Strand of nucleotide sequence to extract. Choice of plus or minus.
mask_sequence_with string none Produce lower-case masked FASTA using the algorithm IDs specified.
out string stdout Output file name.
outfmt string %f Output format, where the available format specifiers  are:
%f means sequence in FASTA format
%s means sequence data (without defline)
%a means accession
%g means gi
%o means ordinal id (OID)
%t means sequence title
%l means sequence length
%T means taxid
%L means common taxonomic name
%S means scientific  name
%P means PIGAppendices 91
