Opt-out of Usage Reporting
Y ou can opt-out of the usage reporting by adding a .ncbirc (UNIX like) or ncbi.ini (Windows) configuration  file. 
In the configuration  file you should add a line under the BLAST section to set BLAST_USAGE_REPORT to 
false. See  here  for details on setting up a configuration  file.
Y ou may also opt-out of the usage reporting by setting the environment variable BLAST_USAGE_REPORT to 
false. In bash (under LINUX) this command would be:
export BLAST_USAGE_REPORT=false
Note that this environment variable is only set in the shell (i.e., window) you are currently using and will not be 
set the next time you login. To permanently opt-out, this variable should be set every time a new shell is opened 
or with a configuration  file, as described above.
Y ou can also set this environment variable, turning off usage reporting, when using BLAST+ docker by adding 
the -e option to your docker invocation:
-e BLAST_USAGE_REPORT=false
