Limiting a Search by taxonomy
Created: June 23, 2008; Updated: January 7, 2021.
In order to limit a BLAST search by taxonomy, one needs to provide the NCBI taxonomy ID(s) (taxid) for given 
organism(s). A taxid is simply a number that specifies  a node in the taxonomic tree. For example, 9606 is the 
taxid for human, 9989 is the taxid for rodentia, and 2 is the taxid for all bacteria. Taxids are preferable to 
organism names as the latter can be ambiguous. For instance, bacteria is both a genus of insects as well as a 
superkingdom.
Additionally, one may use the -negative_taxids and -negative_taxidlist options to exclude sequences by taxid.
