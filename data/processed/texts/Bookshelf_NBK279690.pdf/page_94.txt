option task type default value description and notes
gapopen All integer 11 Cost to open a gap.
gapextend All integer 1 Cost to extend a gap.
matrix All string BLOSUM62 Scoring matrix name.
threshold tblastn integer 13 Minimum score to add a word to the BLAST lookup table.
threshold tblastn-fast Integer 21 Minimum score to add a word to the BLAST lookup table.
seg All string 12 2.2 2.5 Filter query sequence with SEG (Format: 'yes', 'window locut hicut', or 'no' 
to disable).
soft_masking All boolean false Apply filtering  locations as soft masks (i.e., only for finding  initial matches).
lcase_masking All flag N/A Use lower case filtering  in query and subject sequence(s).
db_soft_mask All integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as soft mask (i.e., 
only for finding  initial matches).
db_hard_mask All integer none Filtering algorithm ID to apply to the BLAST database as hard mask (i.e., 
sequence is masked for all phases of search).
xdrop_gap_final All real 25 Heuristic value (in bits) for final  gapped alignment.
window_size All integer 40 Multiple hits window size, use 0 to specify 1-hit algorithm.
db_gen_code All integer 1 Genetic code to translate subject sequences, see ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/
entrez/misc/data/gc.prt
max_intron_length All integer 0 Length of the largest intron allowed in a translated nucleotide sequence 
when linking multiple distinct alignments (a negative value disables 
linking).86 BLASTÂ® Command Line Applications User Manual
