levels attribute must first be modified with the levels() function.

Finally, because factors work much like character vectors, but don’t print their quotes, it can be difficult to tell them apart from other types when printed. This goes for simple character vectors when they are part of data frames. Consider the following printout of a data frame:

Because quotation marks are left off when printing data frames, it’s impossible to tell from this simple output that the id column is a character vector, the tissue column is a factor, the count column is an integer vector, and the group column is a factor.[2] Using class() on individual columns of a data frame can be useful for determining what types they actually are.

Exercises
Next, add to the suffix_only data frame columns for base_id and suffix, where base IDs are the parts before the underscore and suffices are the parts after the underscore (e.g., base_id is "PZ7180000023260" and suffix is "APN" for the ID "PZ7180000023260_APN").

Finally, produce versions of these two data frames where the GO: prefix has been removed from all entries of the second column.

We are interested in pulling out all rows that have "A", "B", or "C" in the current_grade column. Describe, in detail, what each of the three potential solutions does:How does R interpret each one (i.e., what will R try to do for each), and what would the result be? Which one(s) is (are) correct? Which will report errors? Are the following three lines any different fro
