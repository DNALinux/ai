Use group_by(), do(), and write.table() to write the contents of the CO2 data frame into seven text files, one for each conc level. Name them conc_95.txt, conc_175.txt, and so on. You may need paste() or str_c() (from the stringr library) to generate the file names.


Here we’ll be using the colloquial term “gene” to refer to a genetic locus producing messenger RNA and its expression to be represented by the amount of mRNA (of the various isoforms) present in the cell at the sampling time. ↵Microarrays are an older technology for measuring gene expression that have been largely supplanted by direct RNA-seq methods. For both technologies, the overall levels of expression vary between samples (e.g., owing to measurement efficiency) and must be modified so that values from different samples are comparable; microarray data are often  transformed as well in preparation for statistical analysis. Both steps have been performed for these data; we’ve avoided discussion of these preparatory steps as they are specific to the technology used and an area of active research for RNA-seq. Generally, RNA-seq analyses involve work at both the command line for data preprocessing and using functions from specialized R packages. ↵There are many interesting ways we could analyze these data. For the sake of focusing on R rather than statistical methods, we’ll stick to a relatively simple per gene 2x2 ANOVA model. ↵For almost all data type conversions, R has a default interpretation (e.g., vectors a
