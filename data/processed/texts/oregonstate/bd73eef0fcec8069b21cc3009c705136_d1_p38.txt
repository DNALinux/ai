case, the tree has degenerated into a reverse-sorted linked list. So, the insertion time (for 1, for example) is , and finding the smallest item is also, because the tree is heavily unbalanced in a leftward direction. Unfortunately, in practice, we can’t guarantee the order in which data will be inserted, and such runs of consecutive insertions aren’t uncommon in real-world data.

More sophisticated structures called “balanced” binary trees have modifications to their insertion methods that ensure the tree stays bushy, no matter what order items are inserted. This is tricky, as it requires manipulating the structure of the tree after insertions, but the structure manipulation itself can’t take too long or the benefit of insertion is lost. Examples of balanced binary trees include so-called red-black trees, and AVL trees (named after Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who first described them).

In practice, we don’t make a distinction between “bushy” and “un-bushy” binary trees: simple binary-search trees are  for both .insert_item() and .get_smallest(), because we cannot guarantee bushiness (recall that we assume worst-case performance when analyzing an algorithm). Real applications thus use AVL trees, red-black trees, or other more sophisticated data structures.

Back to Sorting
We previously left the topic of sorting having developed bubblesort, an  method for sorting a simple list of items. We can certainly do better.

One of the interesting features of
