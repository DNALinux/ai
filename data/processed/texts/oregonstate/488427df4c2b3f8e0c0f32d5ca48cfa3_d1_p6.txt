t meanings.

R also supports logical connectives, though these take on a slightly different syntax than most other languages.

These can be grouped with parentheses, and usually should be to avoid confusion.

When combining logical expressions this way, each side of an ampersand or | must result in a logical—the code a == 9 | 7 is not the same as a == 9 | a == 7 (and, in fact, the former will always result in TRUE with no warning).

Because R is such a dynamic language, it can often be useful to check what type of data a particular variable is referring to. This can be accomplished with the class() function, which returns a character string of the appropriate type.

We’ll do this frequently as we continue to learn about various R data types.
