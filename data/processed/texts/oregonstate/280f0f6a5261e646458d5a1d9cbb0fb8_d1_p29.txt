stributed evenly between zero and one under the null hypothesis (no difference), for the genotype column alone we could expect ~11,000 * 0.05 = 550 apparently (but erroneously) significant differences. Altering the scenario, suppose there were about 50 genes that truly were differentially expressed in the experiment: these would likely have small p values, but it is difficult to separate them from the other 550 apparently significant values.

There are a variety of solutions to this problem. First, we could consider a much smaller threshold for significance. What threshold should that be? Well, if we wanted the number of apparently—but not really—significant p values to be small (on average), say, 0.05, we could solve for 11,000 * α = 0.05, suggesting a cutoff of α = 0.000004545. This is known as Bonferroni correction. The trouble is, this is a conservative correction, and it’s likely that even our 50 significant genes won’t pass that small threshold.

The reason Bonferroni correction is so conservative is that we’ve specified that we’ll only accept the average number of false positives to be 0.05, which is quite small. We might alternatively say we would accept 10 false positives (and solve for 11,000 * α = 10); if the number of kept results is 100, that’s only a 10% false discovery rate (FDR), and so we can expect 90% of the kept results to be real (but we won’t know which are which!). On the other hand, if the number of kept results ends up being 15, that’s a 75% false dis
