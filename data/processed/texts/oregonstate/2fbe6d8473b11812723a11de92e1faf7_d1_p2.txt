sta, mostly as an excuse to learn about the standard streams and tools like grep and sort. It turns out that the information in the pz_cDNAs.fasta file provides us with many potential questions to ponder.

The sequences in this file are actually a subset of putative transcripts, produced from a de novo transcriptome assembly for the butterfly Papilio zelicaon. Each sequence header line encodes a variety of information: the second and third columns of the header lines reveal the number of reads contributing to each assembled sequence and the average coverage of the sequence (defined as the total number of bases contributed by reads, divided by the assembled sequence length). Even the sequence IDs encode some information: they all start with a pseudorandom identifier, but some have a suffix like _TY.

Groups of sequences that share the same _ suffix were previously identified as having shared matches using a self-BLAST. Sequence IDs without such a suffix had no matches. We might ask: how many sequences are in such a group? This could be easily answered by first using grep to extract lines that match > (the header lines), and then using another grep to extract those with the pattern _ (those in a group) before sending the result to wc.

A more complex question would be to ask how many different groups are represented in the file. If the group information was stored in a separate column (say, the second column), this question could be answered with the same process as above, foll
