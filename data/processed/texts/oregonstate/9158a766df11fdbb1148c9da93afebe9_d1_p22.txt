uallyâ€”a fair percentage of viewers will have some form of color blindness, and another fair percentage of viewers will prefer to print a plot on a black-and-white printer. The scale_color_brewer() function helps the user select good color palettes; it is based on the work found at colorbrewer2.org. Other scale types can be similarly adjusted, including alpha (transparency), and the sizes of points and lines.

Coordinates
In addition to modifying properties of the scales, we can also modify how those scales are interpreted in the overall plot and in relation to each other. Some of the coordinate modifications are less common, but others (like coord_equal(), below) are handy. Often, coordinate adjustments are illustrated by considering a dotplot or barplot in polar coordinates.

The coord_polar() function requires a theta = parameter to indicate which axis (x or y) should be mapped to the rotation angle; the remaining axis is mapped to the radius. This coordinate modification can be used to produce interesting plots, especially when the geom used is "bar" or "line".

The coord_flip() function can be used to flip the x and y axes. This feature is especially useful when the desire is to produce a horizontal histogram or boxplot.

When setting the fill aesthetic, the subbars are stacked, which is the default. For a plot with bars presented side by side, one can add the position = "dodge" argument to the geom_bar() layer call.

For one last coordinate adjustment, the values mapped
