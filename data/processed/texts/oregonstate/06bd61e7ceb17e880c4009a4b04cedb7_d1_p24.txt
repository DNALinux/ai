How do we know which of these we want? We can get a hint by running the uname program, along with the -a parameter to give as much information as possible.

The uname program gives information about the operating system, which in this case appears to be GNU/Linux for a 64-bit, x86 CPU. If any of the binaries are likely to work, it will be the “i86linux64” set. We’ll wget that gzipped tarball in the downloads directory.

Note that in this case we haven’t used the -O option for wget, because the file name described by the URL (muscle3.8.31_i86linux64.tar.gz) is what we would like to call the file when it is downloaded anyway. Continuing on to unpack it, we find it contains only an executable that we can attempt to run.

Because it didn’t report an execution error, we can install it by copying it to our $HOME/local/bin directory. While doing so, we’ll give it a simpler name, muscle.

Now our multiple aligner, muscle, is installed!

Getting Data
Now that we’ve got the software installed for our example analysis, we’ll need to get some data. Supposing we don’t have any novel data to work with, we’ll ask the following question: can we identify, using HMMER and muscle, homologues of P450-1A1 genes in the Drosophila melanogaster protein data set? (This is a useless example, as the D. melanogaster genome is already well annotated.)

The first step will be to download the D. melanogaster data set, which we can find on http://flybase.org, the genome repository for Drosophila
