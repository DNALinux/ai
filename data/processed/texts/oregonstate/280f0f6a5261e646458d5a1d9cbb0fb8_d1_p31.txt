from the data set only those rows where the FDR rate is less than 0.05. (The full analysis script is located in the file expr_analyze.R.)

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how much data one hopes to further analyze), only one gene is identified as having a significant interaction after BY correction in this analysis. (If 100 were returned, we would expect 5 of them to be false positives due to the 0.05 FDR cutoff used.)

For grouped data frames, print() will omit printing some columns if they don’t fit in the display window. To see all the columns (including our new interaction_BY column), we can convert the grouped table back into a regular data frame and print the head() of it with print(head(data.frame(pvals_interaction_sig))). For the curious, the interaction_BY value of this ID is 0.048.
