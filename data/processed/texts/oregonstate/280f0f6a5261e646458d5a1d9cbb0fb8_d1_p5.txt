w).

Does that mean that we can look for genes where the mean difference is large in one genotype, but not the other? Or within one treatment, but not that other? No, because many of these interesting scenarios would be missed:

For each gene’s expression measurements, we need a classic ANOVA (analysis of variance) model. After accounting for the variance explained by the genotype difference (to which we can assign a p value indicating whether there is a difference) as well as the variance explained by the treatment (which will also have a p value), is the leftover variance—for the interaction/differential response—significant?

A Single Gene Test, Formulas
To get started, we’ll run an ANOVA for just a single gene.[3] First, we’ll need to isolate a sub-data frame consisting of readings for only a single ID. We can use the unique() function to get a vector of unique IDs, and then the %in% operator to select rows matching only the first of those.

This data frame contains rows for a single gene and columns for expression, genotype, treatment, and others (we could verify this with a simple print() if needed). We wish to run an ANOVA for these variables, based on a linear model predicting expression values from genotype, treatment, and the interaction of these terms.

The next step is to build a simple linear model using the lm() function, which takes as its only required parameter a “formula” describing how the predictor values should be related to the predicted values. Note the
