have the same number of columns. Further, the column names of the two data frames must be identical. If the types of data are different, then after being combined with rbind(), columns of different types will be converted to the most general type using the same rules when mixing types within vectors.

Using rbind() requires that the data from each input vector be copied to produce the output data frame, even if the variable name is to be reused as in df <- rbind(df, df2). Wherever possible, data frames should be generated with a split-apply-combine strategy (such as with group_by() and do()) or a reshaping technique, rather than with many repeated applications of rbind().

Exercises
Use the spread() function in the tidyr library to produce a CO2_spread data frame that looks like so:
Next, undo this operation with a gather(), re-creating the CO2 data frame as CO2_recreated.

From the CO2 data frame, generate a data frame like the following, where the last two columns report mean uptake for each Type/conc combination:
You’ll likely want to start by computing appropriate group-wise means from the original CO2 data.
