A quine (after the logician and philosopher W. V. Quine) is a nonempty program that prints its own source code exactly. Use the io module and file handles to write a quine called quine.py. (Quine programs aren’t technically allowed to open files. Can you write a program that prints its own source code without using the io module?)


Python includes a simple open() function that works largely the same way as the io.open() shown here. In the newest versions of Python (Python 3.0 and up), open() is actually a shortcut to io.open(), whereas in older versions the two operate slightly differently. For consistency, let’s stick with an explicit io.open(), which works the same in all recent versions (Python 2.7 and up). With regard to the "U" parameter, Microsoft- and Unix-based systems utilize different encodings for newlines. The "U" parameter handles this transparently, so that all types of newlines can be considered as Unix based, \n, even if the file in question was created on a Microsoft system. ↵In many languages, it is good practice to test whether a file handle was successfully opened, and if not, exit the program with an error. We could also do such tests in Python, but because Python by default quits with an informative error in this situation anyway, we won't worry as much about checking for errors here. Python also includes a special with keyword that handles both opening and closing the file:Python documentation recommends usin
