neric plot() function, which can plot many different types of data (such as in the linear model example above), ggplot2 specializes in plotting data stored in data frames.

A “plot” in ggplot2 is made up of the following components:

When installed with install.packages("ggplot2") (in the interactive console) and loaded with library(ggplot2), the package comes with a data frame called diamonds. Each row of this data frame specifies some information about a single diamond; with about 54,000 rows and many types of columns (including numeric and categorical), it is an excellent data set with which to explore plotting.

Let’s start by exploring the most important concept in the list of definitions above: the layer and its five components. To create a layer, we can start by creating an “empty” gg object by calling ggplot() with no parameters. To this we’ll add a layer with + and calling the layer() function, specifying the five components we want.[2] Because these plotting commands become fairly long, we break them up over multiple lines (ending broken lines with + or , to let the interpreter know the command isn’t finished) and indent them to help indicate where different pieces are contributing.

Here, we’ve specified each of the five layer components described above. For the mapping of aesthetics, there is an internal call to an aes() function that describes how aesthetics of the geoms (x and y, and color in this case) relate to columns of the stat-adjusted data (in this case,
