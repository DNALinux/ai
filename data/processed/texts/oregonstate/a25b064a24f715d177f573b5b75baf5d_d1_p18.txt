n_mean, that contains all values of sample that are larger than (or equal to) the median of the sample, and less than (or equal to) the mean of the sample.
Read in the states.txt file into a data frame as described. Extract a numeric vector called murder_lowincome containing murder rates for just those states with per capita incomes less than the median per capita income (you can use the median() function this time). Similarly, extract a vector called murder_highincome containing murder rates for just those states with greater than (or equal to) the median per capita income. Run a two-sample t.test() to determine whether the mean murder rates are different between these two groups.
Let states be the state information data frame described above. Describe what the various operations below do in terms of indexing, selective replacement, vector recycling, and the types of data involved (e.g., numeric vectors and logical vectors). To get you started, the first line adds a new column to the states data frame called "newpop" that contains the same information as the "population" column.Â 
Determine the number of unique regions that are listed in the states data frame. Determine the number of unique regions represented by states with greater than the median income.
What does the sum() function report for a numeric vector c(2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 2)? How about for c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)? And, finally, how about for the logical vector c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)? How could the sum() f
