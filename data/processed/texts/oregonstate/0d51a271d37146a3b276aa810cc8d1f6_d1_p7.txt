ownames() and colnames().

There are a number of interesting functions for working with matrices, including det() (for computing the determinant of a matrix) and t() (for transposing a matrix).

Arrays generalize the concept of multidimensional data; where matrices have only two dimensions, arrays may have two, three, or more. The line a <- array(c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3), dim = c(2,2,3)), for example, creates a three-dimensional array, composed of three two-by-two matrices. The upper left element can be extracted as a[1,1,1].
