k of them as part of the operating system. Technically, however, these are programs that are run by the user (usually automatically at login or startup) and must make requests of the operating system, just like any other program. Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are in reality operating systems bundled with extensive suites of user software.

A Brief History
The complete history of the operating systems used by computational researchers is long and complex, but a brief summary and explanation of several commonly used terms and acronyms such as BSD, “open source,” and GNU may be of interest. (Impatient readers may at this point skip ahead, though some concepts in this subsection may aid in understanding the relationship between computer hardware and software.)

Foundational research into how the physical components that make up computing machinery should interact with users through software was performed as early as the 1950s and 1960s. In these decades, computers were rare, room-sized machines and were shared by large numbers of people. In the mid-1960s, researchers at Bell Labs (then owned by AT&T), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and General Electric developed a novel operating system known as Multics, short for Multiplexed Information and Computing Service. Multics introduced a number of important concepts, including advances in how files are organized and how resources are allocated to multiple users.

In the early 1970s, several enginee
