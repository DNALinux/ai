coverages are increasingly rare.

Although languages like Python and R provide user-friendly data-plotting packages, it can sometimes be helpful to quickly plot a data set on the command line. The gnuplot program can produce not only image formats like PNG and PDF, but also text-based output directly to standard output. Here’s the command to plot the above histogram (but with points, rather than the traditional boxes), along with the output.

It’s a bit difficult to see, but the plotted points are represented by A characters. Breaking down the gnuplot command, set term dumb instructs gnuplot to produce text-based output, plot "-" indicates that we want to plot data from the standard input stream, using 2:1 indicates that X values should be drawn from the second column and Y values from the first, and with points specifies that points—as opposed to lines or boxes—should be drawn. Because the counts of coverages drop off so rapidly, we may want to produce a log/log plot, and we can add a title, too: gnuplot -e 'set term dumb; set logscale xy; plot "-" using 2:1 with points' title "Coverage Counts"

Although we’ve only shown the most basic usage of gnuplot, it is actually a sophisticated plotting package—the various commands are typically not specified on the command line but are rather placed in an executable script. For a demonstration of its capabilities, visit http://gnuplot.info.
