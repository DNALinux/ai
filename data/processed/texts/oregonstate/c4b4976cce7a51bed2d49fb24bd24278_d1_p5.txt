To find out this information, there is the du (disk usage) command, which is almost always combined with the -s (summarize) and -h (show sizes in human-readable format) options.

As always, . is a handy target, here helping to determine the file space used by the present working directory.

Editing a (Text) File
There is no shortage of command-line text editors, and while some of them—like vi and emacs—are powerful and can enhance productivity in the long run, they also take a reasonable amount of time to become familiar with. (Entire books have been written about each of these editors.)

In the meantime, a simple text editor available on most systems is nano; to run it, we simply specify a file name to edit:

If the file doesn’t exist already, it will be created when it is first saved, or “written out.” The nano editor opens up an interactive window much like less, but the file contents can be changed. When done, the key
