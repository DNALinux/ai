ble in a bit. For directories, these permissions take on different meanings.

The temp directory above gives the user all permissions (rwx), but members of the group and others can only cd to the directory and view the files there (r-x); they can’t add or remove files or directories. (They may be able to edit files in temp, however, depending on those files’ permissions.)

The chmod (change mode) utility allows us to add or remove permissions. There are two types of syntax, the simpler “character” syntax and the numeric “octal” syntax. We’ll describe the simpler syntax and leave discussion of the octal syntax for those brave enough to read the manual page (man chmod).

To clarify, here are some examples of modifying permissions for the p450s.fasta file.

If you wish to modify a directory and everything inside, you can add the -R flag (capital R this time for recursive) to chmod. To share a projects directory and everything inside for read access with group members, for example, you can use chmod -R g+r projects.

There are a few small things to note about file and directory permissions. The first is that while it is possible to change the group of a file or directory, you can only do so with the chgrp command if you are a member of that group.

Second, you own the files that you create, but generally only the root user has access to the chown utility that changes the owner of an existing file (it wouldn’t be very nice to “gift” another user a nefarious program).

Third, while
