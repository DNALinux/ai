r. This configuration allows users to “see” the same filesystem hierarchy and files no matter which remote computer they happen to log in to, if more than one is available. (For example, even /home might be a network mount, and so all users’ home directories might be available on a number of machines.)

Getting around the Filesystem
It is vitally important to understand that, as we are working in the command-line environment, we always have a “place,” a directory (or folder) in which we are working called the present working directory, or PWD. The shell keeps track of the present working directory in an environment variable, $PWD.

When you first log in, your present working directory is set to your home directory; echo $PWD and echo $HOME will likely display the same result. There is also a dedicated program for displaying the present working directory, called pwd.

We can list the files and directories that are stored in the present working directory by using the ls command.

This command reveals that I have a number of directories in my home directory (/home/oneils) with names like Music and Pictures (helpfully colored blue) and a file called todo_list.txt.

Notice that the command prompt has changed to illustrate the present working directory: now it shows oneils@atmosphere /home$, indicating that I am in /home. This is a h
