ge Return” (CR) followed by NF): 0000110100001010. This means that text files created on Microsoft operating files may not be readable on Unix-like systems, and vice versa.

Fortunately, there are utilities available for converting between these formats. On the command line, the utilities dos2unix and unix2dos convert to and from Unix-like format, respectively. This isn’t often an issue, as most file transfer programs (FireFTP included) automatically perform the appropriate conversion. The command-line utility file can also be used to determine the type of a file, including its newline type.

Putting It All Together
At this point, we’ve obtained the data we wish to process, and we’ve successfully installed the software we intend to run on that data.

The first step is to run muscle on the p450s.fasta file to produce a multiple alignment. One quick way to identify how a program like muscle should be run (what parameters it takes) is to run it without any parameters. Alternatively, we could try the most common options for getting help: muscle -h, muscle --help, muscle --h, or muscle -help.

The most important line of this help text is the usage information: muscle -in <inputfile> -out <outputfile>; parameters in angle brackets indicate that the parameter is required (nonrequired parameters often appear in straight brackets). Further help text indicates other parameters that we could opt to add. Presumably, they could be placed before or after the input or output specifiers. So,
