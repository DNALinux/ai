BH”) and Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli (from 2001, known as “BY”) differ in the amount of independence the many tests are assumed to have. The BY method assumes less independence between tests but generally results in more results for a given FDR rate. (Consult your local statistician or statistics textbook for details.)
The p.adjust() function allows us to run either the Bonferroni, BH, or BY correction methods. It takes two arguments: first, a vector of p values to adjust, and, second, a method = parameter that can be set to "bonferroni", "BH", or "BY". (There are other possibilities, but these three are the most commonly used.) Returned is a vector of the same length of adjusted FDR values—selecting all entries with values less than Q is equivalent to setting an FDR rate cutoff of Q.
In the final analysis of all genes, we will produce a BY-adjusted column for the interaction p values, and then select from the data set only those rows where the FDR rate is less than 0.05. (The full analysis script is located in the file expr_analyze.R.)

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how much data one hopes to further analyze), only one gene is identified as having a significant interaction after BY correction in this analysis. (If 100 were returned, we would expect 5 of them to be false positives due to the 0.05 FDR cutoff used.)

For grouped data frames, print() will omit printing some columns if they don’t fit in the display window. To see all the columns (including ou
