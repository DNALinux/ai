re many options and special internal functions modifying nearly all aspects of a plot.

Although ggsave() accepts width = and height = parameters specifying the overall size of the output file, because these parameters include the legend and axis labels, the plotting region has its aspect ratio determined automatically. Indicating that the plotting region should take a specific aspect ratio (defined as the height of the region over the width) also occurs within a theme() call.

The observant reader might have noticed that, by default, all plotting regions in ggplot2 use a light gray background. This is intentional: the idea is that a plot with a white background, when embedded into a manuscript, will leave a visual “hole,” interrupting the flow of the text. The shade of gray chosen for the default background is meant to blend in with the overall shade of a column of text.

Some users prefer to use a more traditional white background, but doing so requires adjusting multiple elements, including the background itself, grid lines, and so on. So, ggplot2 includes a number of functions that can change the overall theme, such as theme_bw().

Because calls to theme_bw() et al. modify all theme elements, if we wish to also modify individual theme elements with theme(), those must be added to the chain after the call to theme_bw().

One feature of ggplot2 not yet covered is the use of text within plots, which are not theme adjustments but rather special types of plot layers. The geom_
