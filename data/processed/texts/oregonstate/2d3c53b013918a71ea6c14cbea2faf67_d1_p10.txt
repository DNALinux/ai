and do some printing to ensure you can successfully loop over the lines of the file and split them into lists of strings. Continue on by filling in some of the code in the for-loop, again printing and testing to ensure the code is doing what you think it is. And so on via iterative development.
The second strategy, to avoid the more dangerous bugs that aren’t immediately obvious, is to test and develop your programs using small files for which you can calculate the answer by hand (or some other trusted process). When you know from testing that your program or even just parts of your program produces the intended output, hidden bugs are much less likely to slip through the cracks. Some people produce several small inputs that represent the variety of different input situations, run the tests, and compare the outputs to the expected results in an automated fashion. This is known as “unit testing,” a common practice in professional software development.
Finally, remember that every programmer, no matter her experience level, gets frustrated from time to time! This is entirely normal, and a good strategy when this happens is to take a brief walk, or even take a break for the day, picking up again the next day. Some find they program efficiently in the morning, others late at night. Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to program by trial and error, mindlessly tweaking the code in the hopes that it will produce the output you want. Even if you succeed this way (which rarely happe
