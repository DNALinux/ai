could use that on the standard input and extract the corresponding lines from the GO file.

Exercises
Write a function called codon_to_aa() that takes in a single three-base-pair string and returns a one-character string with the corresponding amino acid code. You may need to define all 64 possibilities, so be careful not to make any typos! If the input is not a valid three-base-pair DNA string, the function should return "X" to signify “unknown.” Test your function with a few calls like print(codon_to_aa("TGG")), print(codon_to_aa("TAA")), and print(codon_to_aa("BOB")).
