, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)? How could the sum() function thus be useful in a logical context?


Most R functions take a large number of parameters, but many of them are optional. In the next chapter, we’ll see what such optional parameters look like, and how to get an extensive list of all the parameters that built-in R functions can take. ↵The term “selective replacement” is not widely used outside of this book. In some situations, the term “conditional replacement” is used, but we wanted to define some concrete terminology to capture the entirety of the idea. ↵When running on the command line, the present working directory is inherited from the shell. In RStudio, the present working directory is set to the “project” directory if the file is part of a project folder. In either case, it is possible to change the working directory from within R using the setwd() directory, as in setwd("/home/username/rproject") in Unix/Linux and setwd("C:/Documents and Settings/username/My Documents/rproject") in Windows. It is also possible to specify file names by absolute path, as in /home/username/rproject/states.txt, no matter the present working directory. ↵If you have any familiarity with R, you might have run across the attach() function, which takes a data frame and results in the creation of a separate vector for each column. Generally, “disassembling” a data frame this way is a bad idea—after all, the columns of a data frame are usually associated with each other for a reason! Furt
