into a temp directory. We could run mv listing the files individually:

Alternatively, we could use mv file*.temp temp; the shell will expand file*.temp into the list of files specified above before passing the expanded list to mv.[2]

Similarly, we could move only fileA.temp and fileB.temp (but not fileAA.temp) using mv file?.tmp temp, because the ? wildcard will only match one of any character. These wildcards may be used anywhere in an absolute or relative path, and more than one may be used in a single path. For example, ls /home/*/*.txt will inspect all files ending in .txt in all users’ home directories (if they are accessible for reading).

Second, if you want to rerun a command, or run a command similar to a previously run command, you can access the command history by pressing the up arrow. Once you’ve identified which command you want to run or modify, you can modify it using the left and right arrows, backspace or delete, and then typing and pressing Enter again when you are ready to execute the modified command. (You don’t even need to have the cursor at the end of the line to press Enter and execute the command.) For a given login session, you can see part of your command history by running the history command.

Finally, one of the best ways to navigate the shell and the filesystem is by using tab completion. When typing a path (either absolute or relative), file or directory name, or even a program name, you can press Tab, and the shell will autocomplete the po
