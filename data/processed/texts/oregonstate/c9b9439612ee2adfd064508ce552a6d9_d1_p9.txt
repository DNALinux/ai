Getting Help
The R interpreter comes with extensive documentation for all of the functions that are built-in. Now that we know how to write functions, reading this documentation will be easy.

The help page for a particular function can be accessed by running help("function_name") in the interactive console, as in help("t.test") for help with the t.test() function.

Alternatively, if the function name contains no special characters, we can use the shorthand ?function_name, as in ?t.test. The help is provided in an interactive window in which you can use the arrow keys to scroll up and down.

The help pages generally have the following sections, and there may be others:

If a function belongs to a package (such as str_split() in the stringr package), one can either load the package first (with library(stringr)) and access the help for the function as usual (help("str_split")), or specify the package directly, as in help("str_split", package = "stringr"). An overview help page for all functions in the package can be accessed with help(package = "stringr").

Finally, in the interactive window, using help.search("average") will search the documentation for all functions mentioning the term “average”—the shortcut for this is ??average.
