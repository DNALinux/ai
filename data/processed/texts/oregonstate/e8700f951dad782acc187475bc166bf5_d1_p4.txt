imple data types that hold either the special value True or the special value False. Many functions return Booleans, as do comparisons:

For now, we won’t use Boolean values much, but later on they’ll be important for controlling the flow of our programs.

Strings
Strings, which hold sequences of letters, digits, and other characters, are the most interesting basic data type.[3] We can specify the contents using either single or double quotes, which can be useful if we want the string itself to contain a quote. Alternatively, we can escape odd characters like quotes if they would confuse the interpreter as it attempts to parse the file.

Strings can be added together with + to concatenate them, which results in a new string being returned so that it can be assigned to a variable. The print() function, in its simplest form, takes a single value such as a string as a parameter. This could be a variable referring to a piece of data, or the result of a computation that returns one:

We cannot concatenate strings to data types that aren’t strings, however.

Running the above code would result in a TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects, and the offending line number would be reported. In general, the actual bug in your code might be before the line reporting the error. This particular error example wouldn’t occur if we had specified height = "5.5" in the previous line, because two strings can be concatenated successfully.

Fortunately, most built-in data types in
