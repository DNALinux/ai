much smaller threshold for significance. What threshold should that be? Well, if we wanted the number of apparently—but not really—significant p values to be small (on average), say, 0.05, we could solve for 11,000 * α = 0.05, suggesting a cutoff of α = 0.000004545. This is known as Bonferroni correction. The trouble is, this is a conservative correction, and it’s likely that even our 50 significant genes won’t pass that small threshold.
The reason Bonferroni correction is so conservative is that we’ve specified that we’ll only accept the average number of false positives to be 0.05, which is quite small. We might alternatively say we would accept 10 false positives (and solve for 11,000 * α = 10); if the number of kept results is 100, that’s only a 10% false discovery rate (FDR), and so we can expect 90% of the kept results to be real (but we won’t know which are which!). On the other hand, if the number of kept results ends up being 15, that’s a 75% false discovery rate, indicating that we can expect most of the kept results to be false positives.
Instead of specifying the number of false positives we’re willing to accept, we can instead specify the rate and deal with whatever number of kept results come out. There are several of these “FDR-controlling” methods available, and some make more assumptions about the data than others. For example, the methods of Benjamini and Hochberg (described in 1995 and known by the acronym “BH”) and Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli (from
