lling library("stringr") or library(stringr), after which the functions provided by the library are available. In this example, we’re using the str_split() function provided by the stringr package; the printed output would be "Hello" "world" rather than "Hello world".

Note that install.packages() needs to be run only once per package, and should usually be done in the interactive R interpreter. The library() function will need to be used (once) for each library in each R script that uses it. These calls are usually collected near the top of the script.
