sing the file:Python documentation recommends using with in this way, as it is slightly safer in cases of program crashes that occur when a file handle is open. Still, we leave this idea to a footnote, as the open and close are explicit and straightforward. ↵In more sophisticated usage of file handles, our pipe analogy breaks down. It’s possible to “rewind” or “fast-forward” the operating system’s current position in the file being read, if we know how far the “read head” needs to move to get to the data we want. Perhaps a better analogy for file handles would be an old-fashioned magnetic cassette tape, perhaps a fitting analogy given that files were once stored on such tapes. ↵It’s also possible to open a file handle for simultaneous reading and writing. We won’t cover it here, as that functionality is less often needed. ↵

Computing a Mean
Let’s put many of the skills we’ve learned so far into practice to compute the mean of the E values from the output of BLAST, which is formatted as a simple text table with tabs separating the columns. Here’s what the file, pz_blastx_yeast_top1.txt, looks like in less -S. Although the reader will have to take our word for it, the eleventh column of this file contains E values like 5e-14, 2e-112, and 1e-18.

When solving a problem like this, it’s usually a good idea to first write, in simple English (or your nonprogramming language of choice), the strategy you intend to use to solve the problem. The strategy here will be as follows: the me
