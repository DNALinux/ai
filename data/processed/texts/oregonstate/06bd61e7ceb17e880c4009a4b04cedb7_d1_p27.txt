y sequences with annotations, many of those annotations have been assigned by automated homology searches and have not been reviewed. The latter, Swiss-Prot, contains only sequences whose annotations have been manually reviewed.

For the download, we’ll enter “p450 1A1” into the search field, and we’ll filter the results to only those in Swiss-Prot by clicking on the “Reviewed” link, resulting in 28 matches. Next, we can click on the “Download” button to download a “FASTA (canonical)” (rather than with all isoforms included) file.

The Uniprot website recently underwent a redesign, such that the downloaded file is transferred directly to the web browser, rather than presented as a URL that could be accessed with wget. This isn’t a problem, as it gives us a chance to discuss how to transfer files between the remote system and local desktop via SFTP.

Like SSH, SFTP is a common client/server protocol. Provided the server is running on the remote computer (in fact, it uses the same port as SSH, port 22, because SSH provides the secure connection), we just need to install and run an SFTP client on our desktop. There are many SFTP clients available for Microsoft Windows (e.g., Core-FTP), OS X (e.g., Cyberduck), and Linux systems (e.g., sftp on the command line or the graphical FileZilla). The client discussed here is called FireFTP, and it is available as an extension for the Mozilla Firefox web browser (itself available for Windows, OS X, and Linux). To get it requires installing
