executed, and perhaps none will be. The if-controlled block is required to start the chain, but one or more else if-controlled blocks and the final else-controlled block are optional.

In R, if we want to include one or more else if blocks or a single else block, the else if() or else keywords must appear on the same line as the previous closing curly bracket. This differs slightly from other languages and is a result of the way the R interpreter parses the code.

Generating Truncated Random Data, Part II
One of the issues with our rnorm_trunc() function is that if the desired range is small, it might still require many resampling efforts to produce a result. For example, calling sample_trunc <- rnorm_trunc(15, 15.01, 1000, 20, 10) will take a long time to finish, because it is rare to randomly generate values between 15 and 15.01 from the given distribution. Instead, what we might like is for the function to give up after some number of resamplings (say, 100,000) and return a vector containing NA, indicating a failed computation. Later, we can check the returned result with is.na().

The example so far illustrates a few different things:

For-Loops
For-loops are the last control-flow structure weâ€™ll study for R. Much like while-loops, they repeat a block of code. For-loops, however, repeat a block of code once for each element of a vector (or list), setting a given variable name to each element of the vector (or list) in turn.

While for-loops are important in many other la
