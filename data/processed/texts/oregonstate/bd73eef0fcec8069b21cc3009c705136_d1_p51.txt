Mergesort






Using random selection for pivot, quicksort() is fast in practice, though mergesort and similar algorithms are frequently used as well. (Python’s .sort() and sorted() use a variant of mergesort called “Timsort.”) Although as mentioned above worst-case analysis is most prevalent in algorithms analysis, quicksort() is one of the few exceptions to this rule.
These discussions of algorithms and data structures might seem esoteric, but they should illustrate the beauty and creativeness possible in programming. Further, recursively defined methods and sophisticated data structures underlie many methods in bioinformatics, including pairwise sequence alignment, reference-guided alignment, and Hidden Markov Models.

Exercises

The first step for writing mergesort() is to write a function called merge(); it should take two sorted lists (together comprising elements) and return a merged sorted version. For example, merge([1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 15], [2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13]) should return the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15], and it should do so in time , where is the total number of elements from both lists. (Note that .append() on a Python list is time , as are mathematical expressions like c = a + b, but other list operations like .insert() are not.)

The mergesort() function should first split the input list into two almost-equal-sized pieces (e.g., first_half = input_list[0:len(input_list)/
