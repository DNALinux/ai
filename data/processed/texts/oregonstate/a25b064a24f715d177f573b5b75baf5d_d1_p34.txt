fault. Because R does a fair amount of formatting when printing, however, it is often more convenient to print data frames using write.table() specifying file = "".

Finally, to get command line parameters into an R script as a character vector, the line args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) will do the trick. Here’s a simple script that will read a table on standard input, write it to standard output, and also read and print out any command line arguments:

Try making this script executable on the command line, and running it on p450s_blastp_yeast_top1.txt with something like cat p450s_blastp_yeast_top1.txt | ./stdin_stdout_ex.R arg1 'arg 2'.
