ubiquitous tool: BLAST, or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.[1]

Given one or more query sequences (usually in FASTA format), BLAST looks for matching sequence regions between them and a subject set.

A sufficiently close match between subsequences (denoted by arrows in the figure above, though matches are usually longer than illustrated here) is called a high-scoring pair (HSP), while a query sequence is said to hit a target sequence if they share one or more HSPs. Sometimes, however, the term “hit” is used loosely, without differentiating between the two. Each HSP is associated with a “bitscore” that is based on the similarity of the subsequences as determined by a particular set of rules. Because in larger subject sets some good matches are likely to be found by chance, each HSP is also associated with an “E value,” representing the expected number of matches one might find by chance in a subject set of that size with that score or better. For example, an E value of 0.05 means that we can expect a match by chance in 1 in 20 similar searches, whereas an E value of 2.0 means we can expect 2 matches by chance for each similar search.

BLAST is not a single tool, but rather a suite of tools (and the suite grows over the years as more features and related tools are added). The most modern version of the software, called BLAST+, is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and may be downloaded in binary and source forms at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.go
