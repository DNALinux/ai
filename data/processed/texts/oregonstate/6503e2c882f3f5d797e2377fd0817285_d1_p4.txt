all six conversions compared to all six on both sides.

Other more exotic BLAST tools include psiblast, which produces an initial search and tweaks the scoring rules on the basis of the results; these tweaked scoring rules are used in a second search, generally finding even more matches. This process is repeated as many times as the user wishes, with more dissimilar matches being revealed in later iterations. The deltablast program considers a precomputed database of scoring rules for different types of commonly found (conserved) sequences. Finally, rpsblast searches for sequence matches against sets of profiles, each representing a collection of sequences (as in HMMER, though not based on hidden Markov models).

All this talk of scoring rules indicates that the specific scoring rules are important, especially when comparing two protein sequences. When comparing protein sequences from two similar species, for example, we might wish to give a poor score to the relatively unlikely match of a nonpolar valine (V) to a polar tyrosine (Y). But for dissimilar species separated by vast evolutionary time, such a mismatch might not be as bad relative to other possibilities. Scoring matrices representing these rule sets with names like BLOSUM and PAM have been developed using a variety of methods to capture these considerations. A discussion of these details can be found in other publications.

Each of the various programs in the BLAST suite accepts a large number of options; try runni
