the printed output of the print(anova1) call above. Because anova1 is a data frame as well as a list, these three names are actually the row names of the data frame. (Sometimes useful data hide in strange places!)

So, given any result of a call to anova(), no matter the formula used in the linear model, we should be able to computationally produce a single-row p-values data frame. But we’ve got to be clever. We can’t just run pvals_df1 <- data.frame(pvals1), as this will result in a single-column data frame with three rows, rather than a single-row data frame with three columns. Rather, we’ll first convert the p-values vector into a list with as.list(), the elements of which will become the columns of the data frame because data frames are a type of list. From there, we can assign the rownames() of anova1 to the colnames() of the pvals_df1 data frame.[4]

The programmatically generated output is as follows:

This time, there’s an extra column for the residuals, but that’s of little significance.

This whole process—taking a sub–data frame representing expression values for a single gene and producing a single-row data frame of p values—is a good candidate for encapsulating with a function. After all, there are well-defined inputs (the sub–data frame of data for a single gene) and well-defined outputs (the p-values data frame), and we’re going to want to run it several thousand times, once for each gene ID.

To get the result for our expr1 sub–data frame, we’d simply need to
