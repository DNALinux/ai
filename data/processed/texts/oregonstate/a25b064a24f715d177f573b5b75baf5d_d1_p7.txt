erate on entire vectors return an NA if any element is NA. A canonical example is the mean() function.

Such functions often include an optional parameter that we can give, na.rm = TRUE, specifying that NA values should be removed before the function is run.

While this is convenient, there is a way for us to remove NA values from any vector (see below).
Other special values in R include NaN, for “Not a Number,” returned by calculations such as the square root of -1, sqrt(-1), and Inf for “Infinity,” returned by calculations such as 1/0. (Inf/Inf, by the way, returns NaN.)
Returning to the concept of vectorized operations, simple arithmetic operations such as +, *, /, -, ^ (exponent), and %% (modulus) are vectorized as well, meaning that an expression like 3 * 7 is equivalent to c(3) * c(7). When the vectors are longer than a single element, the operation is done on an element-by-element basis.


If we consider the * operator, it takes two inputs (numeric or integer) and returns an output (numeric or integer) for each pair from the vectors. This is quite similar to the comparison >, which takes two inputs (numeric or integer or character) and returns a logical.


Vector Recycling

What happens if we try to multiply two vectors that aren’t the same length? It turns out that the shorter of the two will be reused as needed, in a process known as vector recycling, or the reuse of the shorter vector in a vectorized operation.

This works well when working with vectors of length on
