“mainstream” languages like Java, C, and C++ than does R, easing transference of concepts should one wish to continue on the programming journey. Further, R contains a much larger menagerie of data types and specialized syntax for working with them, as well as multiple frameworks for things like variable assignment and object orientation. Effective R programmers arguably have more to keep in mind as they work.

R is a remarkably flexible language. With so much flexibility comes both power and interesting ways of thinking about programming. While Python emphasizes the use of for-loops and if-statements to control program flow, R provides an alternative syntax for manipulation of data through sophisticated logical statements. (For-loops and if-statements are discussed late in this section.) Functions are quite important in Python, but in R they take on such significance that we are required to think about them at a higher level (as types of data that can be operated on by other functions). For many of the statistical tasks in which R excels, the underlying interpreter code is highly optimized or parallelized so that analyses of millions or billions of data points can be completed quickly. Finally, many excellent packages are available only for R.

Ultimately, though, the answer to “which language should I learn?” is as dynamic as “which language should I use?” There are good arguments to be made for (and against) all tools, and the types of skills you wish to acquire and situat
