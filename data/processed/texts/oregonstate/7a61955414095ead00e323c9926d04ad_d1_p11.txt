o look up some information associated with a piece of data but not represented in the data itself? This would be a type of “metadata,” and R allows us to associate metadata to any piece of data using what are called attributes. Suppose we have a simple vector of normally distributed data:

Later, we might want know what type of data this is: is it normally distributed, or something else? We can solve this problem by assigning the term "normal" as an attribute of the data. The attribute also needs a name, which we’ll call "disttype". Attributes are assigned in a fashion similar to names.

When printed, the output shows the attributes that have been assigned as well.

We can separately extract a given attribute from a data item, using syntax like sample_dist <- attr(sample, "disttype"). Attributes are used widely in R, though they are rarely modified in day-to-day usage of the language.[2]

To expand our A. thaliana example, let’s assign a “kingdom” attribute to the species vector.

At this point, we’ve built a fairly sophisticated structure: a list containing vectors (one of which has an attribute) and another list, itself containing vectors, with the various list elements being named. If we were to run print(athal), we’d see rather messy output. Fortunately, R includes an alternative to print() called str(), which nicely prints the structure of a list (or other data object). Here’s the result of calling str(athal) at this point.

Removing an element or attribute from a list i
