We would have had to sort one or both input vectors to get something more reasonable, if that makes sense for the data.

Other plotting functions like hist(), curve(), and boxplot() can be used to produce other plot types. Some plot types (though not all) can be added to previously plotted results as an additional layer by setting add = TRUE. For example, we can produce a dotplot of two random vectors, along with a histogram with normalized bar heights by using hist() with probability = TRUE and add = TRUE.

A plot like this will only look reasonable if the axes ranges are appropriate for both layers, which we must ensure ourselves. We do this by specifying ranges with the xlim = and ylim = parameters in the call to plot(), specifying length-two vectors.

There are a number of hidden rules here. For example, plot() must be called before hist(), as add = TRUE isnâ€™t accepted by the plot() function. Although hist() accepts xlim and ylim parameters, they are ignored when hist() is used with add = TRUE, so they must be specified in the plot() call in this example. There are many individual plotting functions like plot() and hist(), and each takes dozens of parameters with names like "las", "cex", "pch", and "tck" (these control the orientation of y-axis labels, font size, dot shapes, and tick-mark size, respectively). Unfortunately, the documentation of all of these functions and parameters oscillates between sparse and confusingly complex, though there are a numbe
