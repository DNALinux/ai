the need to set so many parameters, using read.table() often results in a long line of code. Fortunately, the R interpreter allows us to break long lines over multiple lines, so long as each line ends on a character that doesn’t complete the expression (so the interpreter knows it needs to keep reading following lines before executing them). Common character choices are the comma and plus sign. When we do wrap a long line in this way, it’s customary to indent the following lines to indicate their continuance in a visual way.

When reading states.txt, the file = parameter specifies the file name to be read, while header = TRUE indicates to the interpreter that the first line in the file gives the column names (without it, the column names will be "V1", "V2", "V3" and so on). The sep = "\t" parameter indicates that tab characters are used to separate the columns in the file (the default is any whitespace), and comment.char = "#" indicates that # characters and anything after them should be ignored while reading the file (which is appropriate, as evident by the # mitten annotation in the file). The stringsAsFactors = FALSE parameter is more cryptic: it tells the interpreter to leave the character-vector columns (like region in this example) as character vectors, rather than convert them to the more sophisticated factor data type (to be covered in later chapters).
At this point, the states variable contains the data frame holding the columns (vectors) of data. We can print it wi
