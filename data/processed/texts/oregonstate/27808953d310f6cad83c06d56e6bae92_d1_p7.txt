nd r"[A-Za-z0-9_]" is shorthand for “any alphanumeric character and the underscore”). Parentheses group patterns, and the plus sign modifies the previous group (or implied group) to match one or more times (* for zero or more), and vertical pipes | work as an “or,” as in r"([ACTG])+(TAG|TAA|TGA)", which will match any sequence of DNA terminated by a stop codon (TAG, TAA, or TGA). Rounding out the discussion from previous chapters, Python regular expressions also support curly brackets (e.g., r"(AT){10,100}" matches an "AT" repeated 10 to 100 times) and standard notation for the start and end of the string. (Note that r"^([ACTG])+$" matches a string of DNA and only DNA. For more detailed examples of these regular expression constructs, refer to chapter 11.)
The regular expression syntax of Python, however, does differ from the POSIX-extended syntax we discussed for sed, and in fact provides an extra-extended syntax known as “Perl-style” regular expressions. These support a number of sophisticated features, two of which are detailed here.
First, operators that specify that a match should be repeated—such as plus signs, curly brackets, and asterisks—are by default “greedy.” The same is true in the POSIX-extended syntax used by sed. In Python, however, we have the option of making the operator non-greedy, or more accurately, reluctant. Consider the pattern r"([ACTG])+(TAG|TAA|TGA)", which matches a DNA sequence terminated by a stop codon. The greedy part, ([ACTG])+, will consume
