sn’t afford us this possibility.

We can perform selective replacement this way as well; let’s suppose Students A and C retake their quizzes and moderately improve their scores.

And the printed output:

In this case, the length of the replacement vector (c(159, 169)) is equal to the number of TRUE values in the indexing vector (c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)); we’ll explore whether this is a requirement below.

In summary, we have three important ways of indexing into/selecting from/selectively replacing in vectors:

Vectorized Operations, NA Values
If vectors are the most basic unit of data in R, all of the functions and operators we’ve been working with—as.numeric(), *, and even comparisons like >—implicitly work over entire vectors.

In this example, each element of the character vector has been converted, so that class(numerics) would return "numeric". The final character string, "9b3x", cannot be reasonably converted to a numeric type, and so it has been replaced by NA. When this happens, the interpreter produces a warning message: NAs introduced by coercion.

NA is a special value in R that indicates either missing data or a failed computation of some type (as in attempting to convert "9b3x" to a numeric). Most operations involving NA values return NA values; for example, NA + 3 returns NA, and many functions that operate on entire vectors return an NA if any element is NA. A canonical example is the mean() function.

Such functions often include an optional parameter that we ca
