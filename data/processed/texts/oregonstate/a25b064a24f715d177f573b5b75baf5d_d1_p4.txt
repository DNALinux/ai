se, whereas there is no standard logical value for a given integer. Similarly, if a numeric is added, everything is converted to numeric.

And if a character string is added, everything is converted into a character string (with 3.5 becoming "3.5", TRUE becoming "TRUE", and so on).

In summary, vectors are the most basic unit of data in R, and they cannot mix types—R will autoconvert any mixed types in a single vector to a “lowest common denominator,” in the order of logical (most specific), integer, numeric, character (most general). This can sometimes result in difficult-to-find bugs, particularly when reading data from a file. If a file has a column of what appears to be numbers, but a single element cannot be interpreted as a number, the entire vector may be converted to a character type with no warning as the file is read in. We’ll discuss reading data in from text files after examining vectors and their properties.
Subsetting Vectors, Selective Replacement
Consider the fact that we can use [] syntax to extract single elements from vectors:

Based on the above, we know that the 20 extracted is a vector of length one. The 2 used in the brackets is also a vector of length one; thus the line above is equivalent to second_el <- nums[c(2)]. Does this mean that we can use longer vectors for extracting elements? Yes!

In fact, the extracted elements were even placed in the resulting two-element vector in the order in which they were extracted (the third element followed by the
