cause the file is gzipped, we can use gzip -d to decompress it, and then use less -S to view the results without the long lines wrapped in the terminal window.

The result illustrates the standard format for a FASTA file. Each sequence record begins with line starting with a > character, and the first non-whitespace-containing word following that is considered the sequence ID.

This line might then contain whitespace characters and metadata. Whitespace comprises a sequence of one or more spaces, tabs (represented in Unix/Linux as a special character sometimes written as \t), or newlines (represented in Unix/Linux as a special character sometimes written as \n) in a row.

Lines following the header line contain the sequence information, and there is no specific format for the number of lines over which the sequence may be broken, or how long those lines should be. After the last sequence line for a record, a new sequence record may start.

Depending on the source of the FASTA file, the IDs or metadata may represent multiple pieces of data; in this example, the metadata are separated by spaces and have a <label>=<value>; format that is specific to protein sequences from FlyBase.

For our next trick, we’ll download some P450-1A1 protein sequences from Uniprot.org. Uniprot.org is a well-known protein database, and it is composed of the “TrEMBL” database and the subset of TrEMBL, known as “Swiss-Prot.” While the former contains many sequences with annotations, many of those annota
