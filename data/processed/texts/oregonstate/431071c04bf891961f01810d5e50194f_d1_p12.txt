o files over time, and it even allows multiple users to log changes, providing the ability to examine differences between the various edits. There are a number of popular version control programs, like svn (subversion) and cvs (concurrent versioning system). Because the job of tracking changes in files across time and users is quite complex (especially when multiple users may be simultaneously making independent edits), using version control software can be a large skill set in itself.

One of the more recently developed version control systems is git, which has gained popularity for a number of reasons, including its use in managing popular software projects like the Linux kernel.[4]The git system (which is managed by a program called git) uses a number of vocabulary words we should define first.

The git system, like all version control systems, is fairly complex and provides many features. The basics, though, are: (1) there is a folder containing the project of interest; (2) changes to some files are made over time; (3) edited files can periodically be “staged”; and (4) a “commit” includes a snapshot of all staged files and stores the information in a “version.” (For the record, all of this information is stored in a hidden directory created within the project directory called .git, which is managed by the git program itself.)

To illustrate, let’s create a repository for the p450s project, edit the runhmmer.sh script file as well as create a README.txt file, and commit th
