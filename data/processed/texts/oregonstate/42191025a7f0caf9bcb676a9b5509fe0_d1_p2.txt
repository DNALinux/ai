s well as the standard graphical user interface (GUI). In this book, we are interested mostly in command line interfaces included as part of an operating system derived from the historically natural environment for scientific computing, Unix, including the various Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu Linux and Red Hat Linux), BSD Unix, and Mac OS X.

Even so, an understanding of modern computer operating systems and how they interact with the hardware and other software is useful. An operating system is loosely taken to be the set of software that manages and allocates the underlying hardware—divvying up the amount of time each user or program may use on the central processing unit (CPU), for example, or saving one user’s secret files on the hard drive and protecting them from access by other users. When a user starts a program, that program is “owned” by the user in question. If a program wishes to interact with the hardware in any way (e.g., to read a file or display an image to the screen), it must funnel that request through the operating system, which will usually handle those requests such that no one program may monopolize the operating system’s attention or the hardware.

The figure above illustrates the four main “consumable” resources available to modern computers:

Because the software interfaces we use every day—those that show us our desktop icons and allow us to start other programs—are so omnipresent, we often think of them as part of the operating system. Technic
