of their work (and with it, the Unix legacy).

While Stallmann and the FSF managed to re-create most of the software that made up the standard Unix environment (the bundled software), they did not immediately re-create the core of the operating system (also called the kernel). In 1991, computer science student Linus Torvalds began work on this core GPL-licensed component, which he named Linux (pronounced “lin-ucks,” as prescribed by the author himself). Many other developers quickly contributed to the project, and now Linux is available in a variety of “distributions,” such as Ubuntu Linux and Red Hat Linux, including both the Linux kernel and a collection of Unix-compatible GPL (and occasionally non-GPL) software. Linux distributions differ primarily in what software packages come bundled with the kernel and how these packages are installed and managed.

Today, a significant number of software projects are issued under the GPL, BSD, or similar “open” licenses. These include both the Python and R projects, as well as most of the other pieces of software covered in this book. In fact, the idea has caught on for noncode projects as well, with many documents (including this one) published under open licenses like Creative Commons, which allow others to use materials free of charge, provided certain provisions are followed.
