the columns (vectors) of data. We can print it with print(states), but the result is quite a lot of output:

It might make better sense to extract just the first 10 rows of data and print them, which we can do with the head() function (head() can also extract just the first few elements of a long vector).

The functions nrow() and ncol() return the number of rows and columns of a data frame, respectively (which is preferred over length(), which returns the number of columns); the dim() function returns a two-element vector with number of rows (at index 1) and number of columns (at index 2).
As mentioned previously, individual columns of a data frame are (almost always) vectors. To access one of these individual vectors, we can use a special $ syntax, with the column name following the $.

So long as the column name is sufficiently simple (in particular, so long as it doesn’t have any spaces), then the quote marks around the column name can be (and often are) omitted.

Although this syntax can be used to extract a column from a data frame as a vector, note that it refers to the vector within the data frame as well. In a sense, states$income is the vector stored in the states data frame. Thus we can use techniques like selective replacement to work with them just like any other vectors. Here, we’ll replace all instances of “North Central” in the states$region vector with just the term “Central,” effectively renaming the region.[4]
