The RGB Color System
RBG stands for red, green, blue. Computer monitors and other digital devices display colors by the varying intensities of tiny red, green, and blue light-emitting devices. A triplet of these makes up a single pixel in the display. The RGB scheme encodes a color as #<RR><GG><BB>, where <RR> encodes the amount of red light, <GG> the amount of green, and <BB> the amount of blue. These values can range from 00 (off) to FF (fully on); these are numbers encoded in hexadecimal format, meaning that after 9, the next digit is A, then B, and so on, up to F. (Counting from 49, for example, the next numbers are 4A, 4B, . . . 4F, 50, 51, etc.) Why red, green, and blue? Most humans have three types of cone cells in their eyes, and each is most responsive to either red, green, or blue light! An RGB scheme can thus represent nearly all colors that humans can see, though in the end we are limited by the gradations (#<RR><GG><BB> format can only take about 16.7 million different values) and the quality of the light-emitting devices (many of which can’t produce very bright light or be fully turned off in operation). Color blindness is a genetic anomaly caused by having only one or two of the three cone types, and a few rare but lucky individuals possess four cone types along with greater acuity in color vision (tetrachromacy).

Something to consider when devising color scales is that not all of them are created equally—a fair percentage of viewers will have some
