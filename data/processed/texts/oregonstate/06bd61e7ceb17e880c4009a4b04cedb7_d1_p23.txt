in a larger database of sequences. For details, the HMMER documentation (available on the website) is highly recommended, particularly the “Tutorial” section, which describes turning a multiple alignment of sequences into a profile (with hmmbuild) and searching that profile against the larger set (with hmmsearch). It is also useful to read the peer-reviewed publication that describes the algorithms implemented by HMMER or any other bioinformatics software. Even if the material is outside your area of expertise, it will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of software.

We’ll soon get to downloading query and target sequence sets, but we’ll quickly come to realize that although the programs in the HMMER suite can produce the profile and search it against the target set, they cannot produce a multiple alignment from a set of sequences that are similar but not all the same length. Although there are many multiple-alignment tools with different features, we’ll download the relatively popular muscle. This time, we’ll install it from binaries.

It’s worth discussing how one goes about discovering these sequences of steps, and which tools to use. The following strategies generally work well, though creativity is almost always rewarded.

If we visit the muscle homepage, we’ll see a variety of download options, including binaries for our system, Linux.

Unfortunately, there appear to be two options for Linux binaries: 32-bit and 64-bit. How do we know which of these we want? We can get
