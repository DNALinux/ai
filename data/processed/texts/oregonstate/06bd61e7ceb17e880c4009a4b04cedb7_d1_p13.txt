STA file. Each sequence record begins with line starting with a > character, and the first non-whitespace-containing word following that is considered the sequence ID.

This line might then contain whitespace characters and metadata. Whitespace comprises a sequence of one or more spaces, tabs (represented in Unix/Linux as a special character sometimes written as \t), or newlines (represented in Unix/Linux as a special character sometimes written as \n) in a row.
Lines following the header line contain the sequence information, and there is no specific format for the number of lines over which the sequence may be broken, or how long those lines should be. After the last sequence line for a record, a new sequence record may start.
Depending on the source of the FASTA file, the IDs or metadata may represent multiple pieces of data; in this example, the metadata are separated by spaces and have a <label>=<value>; format that is specific to protein sequences from FlyBase.
For our next trick, we’ll download some P450-1A1 protein sequences from Uniprot.org. Uniprot.org is a well-known protein database, and it is composed of the “TrEMBL” database and the subset of TrEMBL, known as “Swiss-Prot.” While the former contains many sequences with annotations, many of those annotations have been assigned by automated homology searches and have not been reviewed. The latter, Swiss-Prot, contains only sequences whose annotations have been manually reviewed.
For the download, we’ll enter “p450
