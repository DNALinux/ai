ficant alignment. BLAST searches for high scoring sequence alignments between the query sequence and the existing sequences in the database using a heuristic approach that approximates the Smith-Waterman algorithm. However, the exhaustive Smith-Waterman approach is too slow for searching large genomic databases such as GenBank. Therefore, the BLAST algorithm uses a heuristic approach that is less accurate than the Smith-Waterman algorithm but over 50 times faster. [8] The speed and relatively good accuracy of BLAST are among the key technical innovations of the BLAST programs.

An overview of the BLAST algorithm (a protein to protein search) is as follows:[12]

Types of BLAST[edit]
BLASTn compares one or more nucleotide sequence to a database or another sequence. This is useful when trying to identify evolutionary relationships between organisms. [14]

tBLASTn used to search for proteins in sequences that haven't been translated into proteins yet. It takes a protein sequence and compares it to all possible translations of a DNA sequence. This is useful when looking for similar protein-coding regions in DNA sequences that haven't been fully annotated, like ESTs (short, single-read cDNA sequences) and HTGs (draft genome sequences). Since these sequences don't have known protein translations, we can only search for them using tBLASTn.[15]

BLASTx compares a nucleotide query sequence, which can be translated into six different protein sequences, against a database of known protei
