directory names. The command cd mydocuments is much easier to type than cd my\ documents or cd 'my documents'. (3) If you forget to specify cd before specifying a path, a cryptic permission denied error will occur, rather than an error specific to the lack of cd command.

By default, when running the ls program to list the contents of the present working directory, all files and directories that start with a . are hidden. To see everything including the hidden files, we can add the -a flag to ls.

It turns out there are quite a few hidden files here! Many of those starting with a ., like .bash_login, are actually configuration files used by various programs. We’ll spend some time with those in later chapters.

On the topic of ls, there are many additional parameters we can give to ls: include -l to show “long” file information including file sizes, and -h to make those file sizes “human readable” (e.g., 4K versus 4,196 bytes). For ls, we can specify this combination of options as ls -l -a -h (where the parameters may be given in any order), or with a single parameter as ls -lah, though not all utilities provide this flexibility.

Some of these columns of information are describing the permissions associated with the various files and directories; we’ll look at the permissions scheme in detail in later chapters.
