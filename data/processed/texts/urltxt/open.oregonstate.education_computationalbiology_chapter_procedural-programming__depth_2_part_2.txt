n accomplish a lot by making use of vectorized operations, vector recycling, logical indexing, split-apply-combine, and so on. In general, R heavily emphasizes vectorized and functional operations, and these approaches should be used when possible; they are also usually optimized for speed. Still, R provides the standard repertoire of loops and conditional structures (which form the basis of the “procedural programming” paradigm) that can be used when other methods are clumsy or difficult to design. We’ve already seen functions, of course, which are incredibly important in the vast majority of programming languages.

Conditional Looping with While-Loops
A while-loop executes a block of code over and over again, testing a given condition (which should be or return a logical vector) before each execution. In R, blocks are delineated with a pair of curly brackets. Standard practice is to place the first opening bracket on the line, defining the loop and the closing bracket on a line by itself, with the enclosing block indented by two spaces.
