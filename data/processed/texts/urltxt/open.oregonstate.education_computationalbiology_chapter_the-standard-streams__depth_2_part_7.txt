ncept at play here, that of iterative development, the idea that as we get closer to a solution, we inspect the results and repeat as necessary. Iterative development is a good strategy for many areas in life, but it is essential and pervasive in computing.

Once we’ve decided that we like the small computational process we have created, we might decide to encapsulate it and make it repeatable as a shell script, perhaps called count_ATs.sh.

The above script will need to be made executable and placed in a location referenced by $PATH, as will the fasta_stats program.
