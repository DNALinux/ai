Libraries/Packages
While a default installation of the R interpreter includes a huge number of functions and packages, many additional libraries have been made available on CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), providing important new functions. Fortunately, installing these libraries from CRAN is easy and requires only the interactive R interpreter and an internet connection.[2]

As an example, we’ll install the stringr package, which provides additional functions for working with character-like data types (this will be the first additional package we’ll need in later chapters). To install it at the interactive R console, we need to run install.packages("stringr"). You may be asked whether the package should be installed in a “personal library” and whether to create such a personal library, to which you can answer y. You may also be prompted to select a nearby geographical location from which to download the package, also known as a “mirror.”

Once the package has been installed, using it in an R script is as easy as first calling library("stringr") or library(stringr), after which the functions provided by the library are available. In this example, we’re using the str_split() function provided by the stringr package; the printed output would be "Hello" "world" rather than "Hello world".
