loyed to inspect the beginning or end of a file (to check results or formatting). They also commonly extract test data sets. For example, head -n 40000 input.fastq > test.fastq would extract the first 10,000 sequence records from input.fastq and produce test.fastq (because every four lines of a FASTQ sequence file represents information for a single sequence).

The above shows the first 12 lines of a FASTQ file generated on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The first line in each set of four represents an identifier for the sequence read, the second line contains the sequence itself, the third line is often unused (containing only a +, though it may be followed by the identifier and other optional data), and the fourth line contains the “quality” of each base in the sequence encoded as a character. (The encoding has varied in the past, but in recent years, sequencing companies have standardized the encoding used by Sanger sequencing machines.)

With a bit of modified syntax, tail can also be used to extract all lines of a file starting at a given line. As an example, tail -n +5 input.fastq > test.fastq would result in test.fastq having all but the first sequence record of input.fastq (i.e., starting at the fifth line). This feature is especially useful for stripping off header lines of output or files before further processing, as in ./fasta_stats pz_cDNAs.fasta | tail -n +9, rather than using grep -v '#' above.
