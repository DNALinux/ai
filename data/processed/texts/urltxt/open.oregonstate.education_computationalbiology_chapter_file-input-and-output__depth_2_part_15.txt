ever written top-to-bottom in their entirety, at least not without requiring significant debugging! You may forget that the result of splitting a string results in a list of strings, resulting in an error on a line like eval_sum = eval_sum + eval_str because eval_sum is a float, while eval_str is a string. After finding and fixing this error, you may find yet another error if you attempt to print with a line like print("Mean is: " + mean), because again the types don’t match and can’t be concatenated. After all this, perhaps you find the resulting mean to unexpectedly be a large number, like 131.18, only to find out it was because you accidently used eval_str = line_list[11], forgetting that list indices start at 0.
