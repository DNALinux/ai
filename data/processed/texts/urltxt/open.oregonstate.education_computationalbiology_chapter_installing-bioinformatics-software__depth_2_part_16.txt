parameters. Alternatively, we could try the most common options for getting help: muscle -h, muscle --help, muscle --h, or muscle -help.

The most important line of this help text is the usage information: muscle -in <inputfile> -out <outputfile>; parameters in angle brackets indicate that the parameter is required (nonrequired parameters often appear in straight brackets). Further help text indicates other parameters that we could opt to add. Presumably, they could be placed before or after the input or output specifiers. So, we’ll run muscle on our p450s.fasta file, and produce a file whose file name indicates its pedigree in some way:

Once the command has finished executing, we can view the alignment file with less -S p450s.fasta.aln.

With further inspection, we’d see that the sequences have been made the same length by the insertion of gap characters. The next step is to run hmmbuild to produce the HMM profile. Again, we’ll run hmmbuild without any options to get information on what parameters it needs.
