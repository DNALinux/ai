that the output is human readable, by replacing one or more spaces and tabs by an appropriate number of spaces so that columns are visually aligned: column -t <file> or ... | column -t.

By now, it should be no surprise that column writes its output to standard output. Hereâ€™s the result of join -1 1 -2 1 pz_stats.sorted.txt pz_blastx_yeast_top1.sorted.txt | column -t | less -S, which contains the same data as above, but with spaces used to pad out the columns appropriately.

Because most tools like awk and sort use any number of whitespace characters as column delimiters, they can also be used on data post-column.

There are several important caveats when using join. First, if any entries in the key columns are repeated, the output will contain a row for each matching pair of keys.
