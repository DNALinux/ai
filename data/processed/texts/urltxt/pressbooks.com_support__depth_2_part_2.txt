How can I get help using Pressbooks with my publishing project?
Start by searching our user guide or YouTube channel to try to find an answer to your question in our existing documentation.

If you don’t find what you’re looking for there, you can post your question on our community forum in the hopes that there are other users who know the answer.

If you’re using an enterprise hosted Pressbooks instance, you can always contact the network managers who administer for your Pressbooks installation. If you’re an individual using the self-publishing platform we host at pressbooks.pub, you can purchase a premium support subscription to get personalized support from our team via email.

Learn more about our specific support policies to find out what’s available to you depending on the type of network your account is set up on.

How can I report a bug with the software?
Pressbooks is free and openly licensed software, which means anyone can inspect and improve the code. If you’ve experienced what you think is a bug in our software or have an idea to help us make Pressbooks better, please file a ticket in our main GitHub repository.

How can I get a physical copy of a book I’ve published with Pressbooks?
To get a physical copy of a book you’ve published with Pressbooks, you’ll need to select a print-on-demand service and share the print PDF export files you’ve created using Pressbooks. See our guide chapters on producing PDF exports and distributing your book.
