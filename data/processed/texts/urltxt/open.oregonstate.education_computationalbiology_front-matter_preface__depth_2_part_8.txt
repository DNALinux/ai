nd the third introducing programming in R. Though there are some dependencies between parts (for example, chapter 21, “Bioinformatics Knick-knacks and Regular Expressions,” forgoes duplication of topics from chapter 11, “Patterns (Regular Expressions)”), readers sufficiently interested in only Python or only R should be able to start at those points. Nevertheless, the parts are given their order for a reason: command-line efficiency introduces “computational” thinking and problem solving, Python is a general-purpose language that emphasizes good coding practice, and R specializes in certain types of analyses but is trickier to work with. Understanding these three general topics constitutes a solid basis for computational biologists in the coming decade or more.
