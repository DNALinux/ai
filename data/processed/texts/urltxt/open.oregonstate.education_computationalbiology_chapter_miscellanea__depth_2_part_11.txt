HOME/projects/p450s directory). In particular, we initially created a script to automate running HMMER on some data files, called runhmmer.sh. Here are the contents of the project directory when last we saw it:

It may be that as we continue working on the project, we will make adjustments to the runhmmer.sh script or other text files in this directory. Ideally, we would be able to access previous versions of these filesâ€”in case we need to refer back for provenance reasons or we want to undo later edits. One way to accomplish this task would be to frequently create backup copies of important files, perhaps with file names including the date of the backup. This would quickly become unwieldy, however.

An alternative is to use version control, which is a system for managing changes to files (especially programs and scripts) over time and across various contributors to a project. A version control system thus allows a user to log changes to files over time, and it even allows multiple users to log changes, providing the ability to examine differences between the various edits. There are a number of popular version control programs, like svn (subversion) and cvs (concurrent versioning system). Because the job of tracking changes in files across time and users is quite complex (especially when multiple users may be simultaneously making independent edits), using version control software can be a large skill set in itself.
