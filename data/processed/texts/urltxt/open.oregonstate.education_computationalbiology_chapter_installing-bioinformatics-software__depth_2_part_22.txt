; for example, file hmmer-3.1b1.tar.gz reports that the file is gzip-compressed data, and would do so even if the file did not end in .gz. ↵It's not strictly necessary to log back out and back in; when working in bash, running hash -r will cause the shell to update its list of software found in $PATH. ↵

Installation from Binaries
Our objective is to run HMMER to search for a sequence-set profile in a larger database of sequences. For details, the HMMER documentation (available on the website) is highly recommended, particularly the “Tutorial” section, which describes turning a multiple alignment of sequences into a profile (with hmmbuild) and searching that profile against the larger set (with hmmsearch). It is also useful to read the peer-reviewed publication that describes the algorithms implemented by HMMER or any other bioinformatics software. Even if the material is outside your area of expertise, it will reveal the strengths and weaknesses of software.

We’ll soon get to downloading query and target sequence sets, but we’ll quickly come to realize that although the programs in the HMMER suite can produce the profile and search it against the target set, they cannot produce a multiple alignment from a set of sequences that are similar but not all the same length. Although there are many multiple-alignment tools with different features, we’ll download the relatively popular muscle. This time, we’ll install it from binaries.
