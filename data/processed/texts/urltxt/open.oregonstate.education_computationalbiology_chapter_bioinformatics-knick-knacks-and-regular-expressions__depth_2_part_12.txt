Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a method for identifying genetic variants in a DNA sample by first splitting chromosomes in pseudorandom locations through the application of restriction enzymes and then sequencing short reads from the ends of the resulting fragments: In the above, black lines represent input DNA sequence, red lines are cut sites, and green lines represent output from the sequencing machine. (Some simplifications have been made to the figure above for the sake of clarity.) The result is much higher depth of sequencing at fewer locations, which can be useful in a variety of contexts, including looking for genetic variants between different versions of the same chromosome (which requires many reads from the same location to statistically confirm those variants).

The restriction enzymes cut on the basis of patterns; for example, the ApeK1 enzyme cuts DNA molecules at the pattern "GC[AT]GC". Based on the recognized patterns, some enzymes are “frequent cutters” and some are not; more frequent cutters sample more locations in a genome but sacrifice depth of sequencing. For this reason, researchers often want to know, given an enzyme pattern and genome sequence, the distribution of fragment lengths that will result.
