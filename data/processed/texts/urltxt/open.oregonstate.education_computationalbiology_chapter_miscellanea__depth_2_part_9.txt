he traditional boxes), along with the output.

It’s a bit difficult to see, but the plotted points are represented by A characters. Breaking down the gnuplot command, set term dumb instructs gnuplot to produce text-based output, plot "-" indicates that we want to plot data from the standard input stream, using 2:1 indicates that X values should be drawn from the second column and Y values from the first, and with points specifies that points—as opposed to lines or boxes—should be drawn. Because the counts of coverages drop off so rapidly, we may want to produce a log/log plot, and we can add a title, too: gnuplot -e 'set term dumb; set logscale xy; plot "-" using 2:1 with points' title "Coverage Counts"

Although we’ve only shown the most basic usage of gnuplot, it is actually a sophisticated plotting package—the various commands are typically not specified on the command line but are rather placed in an executable script. For a demonstration of its capabilities, visit http://gnuplot.info.

For-Loops in bash
Sometimes we want to run the same command or similar commands as a set. For example, we may have a directory full of files ending in .tmp, but we wished they ended in .txt.

Because of the way command line wildcards work, we can’t use a command like mv *.tmp *.txt; the *.tmp would expand into a list of all the files, and *.txt would expand into nothing (as it matches no existing file names).
