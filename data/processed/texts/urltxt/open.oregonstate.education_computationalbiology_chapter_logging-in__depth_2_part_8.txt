gate to http://cyverse.org/atmosphere and click on the link for “Create an Account” or “Launch Atmosphere.” If you need to create a new account, do so—CyVerse requests a variety of information for account creation to help gauge user interest and garner funding support. You may also need to request special access to the Atmosphere system through your account on the Atmosphere homepage, as Atmosphere is more resource intensive than other tools provided by CyVerse.

After clicking on the “Launch” link, you will have the opportunity to enter your username and password (if you have been granted one).

The Atmosphere system works by divvying up clusters of physical computers (located at one of various providers around the country) into user-accessible virtual machines of various sizes. When performing a computation that requires many CPU cores, for example, one might wish to access a new “instance” with 16 CPUs, 64 gigabytes (GB) of RAM, and 800 GB of hard disk space. On the other hand, for learning purposes, you will likely only need a small instance with 1 CPU and 4 GB of RAM. This is an important consideration, as CyVerse limits users to a certain quota of resources. Users are limited by the number of “atmosphere units” (AUs) they can use per month, defined roughly as using a single CPU for an hour. Users are also limited in the total number of CPUs and total amount of RAM they can use simultaneously.
