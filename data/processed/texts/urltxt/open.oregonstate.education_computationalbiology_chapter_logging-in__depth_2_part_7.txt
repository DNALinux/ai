with command-line access. This is often the case for individuals at universities and other research or educational institutions. Many users have access to such systems but don’t even realize it, as the service is not often widely advertised.

For those without institutional access, there are a few alternatives. First, Mac OS X machines are themselves Unix-based and come with a command-line interface (via the Terminal application), though the command-line tools differ vary slightly from the GNU-based tools found on most Linux distributions. A web search for “OS-X GNU core utils” will turn up some instructions for remedying this discrepancy. Second, it is possible to install a Linux distribution (like Ubuntu Linux) on most desktops and laptops by configuring the computer to “dual boot” Linux and the primary operating system. Alternatively, Linux distributions can be installed within “virtual machine” software, like VirtualBox (http://virtualbox.org).
