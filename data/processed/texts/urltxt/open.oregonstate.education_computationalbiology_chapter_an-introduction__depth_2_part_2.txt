ater, the open-source R project extended the capabilities of S while incorporating features of languages like LISP and Scheme.

Many features of R are shared with Python: both are high-level, interpreted languages. (For a discussion of interpreted vs. compiled languages, see chapter 13, “Hello, World”.) Both languages provide a wide array of features and functions for common tasks, and both languages are buttressed by a staggering variety of additional packages for more specialized analyses. Superficially, much of their syntax is similar, though below the surface lie significant (and fascinating) differences.
