red by the lengths column:

Because data frames force all column vectors to be the same length, we can create new columns by assigning to them by name, and relying on vector recycling to fill out the column as necessary. Letâ€™s create a new column called gc_categories, which is initially filled with NA values, and then use selective replacement to assign values "low" or "high" depending on the contents of the gcs column.

While there are more automated approaches for categorizing numerical data, the above example illustrates the flexibility and power of the data frame and vector syntax covered so far.

One final note: while the head() function returns the first few elements of a vector or list, when applied to a data frame, it returns a similar data frame with only the first few rows.

Matrices and Arrays
Depending on the type of analysis, you might find yourself working with matrices in R, which are essentially two-dimensional vectors. Like vectors, all elements of a matrix must be the same type, and attempts to mix types will result in autoconversion. Like data frames, they are two dimensional, and so can be indexed with [<row_selector>, <column_selector>] syntax. They also have rownames() and colnames().

There are a number of interesting functions for working with matrices, including det() (for computing the determinant of a matrix) and t() (for transposing a matrix).
