Relative Paths, Hidden Files, and Directories
It isnâ€™t always necessary to specify the full, absolute path to locate a file or directory; rather, we can use a relative path. A relative path locates a file or directory relative to the present working directory. If the present working directory is /home/oneils, for example, a file located at the absolute path /home/oneils/Pictures/profile.jpg would have relative path Pictures/profile.jpg. For the file /home/oneils/todo_list.txt, the relative path is just todo_list.txt. If the present working directory was /home, on the other hand, the relative paths would be oneils/Pictures/profile.jpg and oneils/todo_list.txt.

Because relative paths are always relative to the present working directory (rather than the root directory /), they cannot start with a forward slash, whereas absolute paths must start with a leading forward slash. This distinction occasionally confuses new users.

We can use the cd command with relative paths as well, and this is most commonly done for directories present in the current working directory, as reported by ls. In fact, both relative and absolute paths are allowed wherever a file or directory needs to be specified.
