including generating random samples from them. Many distributions are supported, including the Normal (Gaussian), Log-Normal, Exponential, Gamma, Student’s t, and so on. Here we’ll just look at generating samples from a few for use in future examples.
First, the rnorm() function generates a numeric vector of a given length sampled from the Normal distribution with specified mean (with mean =) and standard deviation (with sd =).

Similarly, the runif() function samples from a uniform distribution limited by a minimum and maximum value.

The rexp() generates data from an Exponential distribution with a given “rate” parameter, controlling the rate of decay of the density function (the mean of large samples will approach 1.0/rate).


R includes a large number of statistical tests, though we won’t be covering much in the way of statistics other than a few driving examples. The t.test() function runs a two-sided student’s t-test comparing the means of two vectors. What is returned is a more complex data type with class "htest".

When printed, this complex data type formats itself into nice, human-readable output:
