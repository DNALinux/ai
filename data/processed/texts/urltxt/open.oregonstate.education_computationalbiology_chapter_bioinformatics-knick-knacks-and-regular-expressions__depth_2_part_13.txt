ould return a dictionary mapping sequence lengths, rounded down to the nearest bin size, to the number of fragments produced by the cutter in that bin. As an example, "AAAAGCAGCAAAAAAGCTGCAAGCAGCAAAAA" when processed with "GC[AT]GC" produces fragment sizes of 4, 6, 2, and 5. If grouped in a bin size of 3, the dictionary would have keys 0, 3, and 6, and values 1, 1, and 2.


Actually, it returns a tuple, which works much like a list but is immutable. Tuples are briefly covered in chapter 15. â†µ

Searching for a Pattern in a String
Searching for a pattern is accomplished with the re.search() function. Most functions in the re module return a special SRE_Match data type, or a list of them (with their own set of methods), or None if no match was found. The if- statement (and while-loops) in Python treats None as false, so we can easily use re.search() in an if-statement. The result of a successful match can tell us the location of the match in the query using the .start() method:
