ment that none of the ~11,000 genes are differentially expressed in any way. Because p values are distributed evenly between zero and one under the null hypothesis (no difference), for the genotype column alone we could expect ~11,000 * 0.05 = 550 apparently (but erroneously) significant differences. Altering the scenario, suppose there were about 50 genes that truly were differentially expressed in the experiment: these would likely have small p values, but it is difficult to separate them from the other 550 apparently significant values.

There are a variety of solutions to this problem. First, we could consider a much smaller threshold for significance. What threshold should that be? Well, if we wanted the number of apparently—but not really—significant p values to be small (on average), say, 0.05, we could solve for 11,000 * α = 0.05, suggesting a cutoff of α = 0.000004545. This is known as Bonferroni correction. The trouble is, this is a conservative correction, and it’s likely that even our 50 significant genes won’t pass that small threshold.
