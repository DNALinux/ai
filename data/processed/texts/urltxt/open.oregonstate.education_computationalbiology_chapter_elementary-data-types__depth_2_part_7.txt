Hereâ€™s how we might represent these variables and the data stored in memory, both before and after the reassignment of seqa.

Because the string "ACTAG" is immutable, redefining seqa results in an entirely different piece of data being created. The original string "ACTAG" will still exist in memory (RAM) for a short time, but because it is not accessible via any variables, Python will eventually clean it out to make room in memory in a process known as garbage collection.[4] Garbage collection is an automatic, periodic process of de-allocating memory used by data that are no longer accessible (and hence no longer needed) by the program.
