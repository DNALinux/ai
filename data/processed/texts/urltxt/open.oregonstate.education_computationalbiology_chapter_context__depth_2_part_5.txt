what we can only presume was enthusiasm. Unsurprisingly, the new terms and costs were not favorable for the largely academic and research-focused user base of Unix, causing great concern for many so heavily invested in the technology.

Fortunately, a group of researchers at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, had been working on their own research with Unix for some time, slowly reengineering it from the inside out. By the end of AT&T’s antitrust suit, they had produced a project that looked and worked like AT&T’s Unix: BSD (for Berkeley Systems Distribution) Unix. BSD Unix was released under a new software license known as the BSD license: anyone was free to copy the software free of charge, use it, modify it, and redistribute it, so long as anything redistributed was also released under the same BSD license and credit was given to UC Berkeley (this last clause was later dropped). Modern versions of BSD Unix, while not used heavily in academia, are regarded as robust and secure operating systems, though they consequently often lack cutting-edge or experimental features.
