And, when we run ls, we find that no output file has been created.

It seems that hmmsearch, by default, prints all of its meaningful output to the terminal. Actually, hmmsearch is printing its output to the standard output stream. Standard output is the primary output mechanism for command-line programs (other than writing files directly). By default, standard output, also known as “standard out” or “stdout,” is printed to the terminal.
Fortunately, it is possible to redirect the standard output stream into a file by indicating this to our shell with a > redirect operator, and specifying a file name or path. In this case, we’ll redirect the output of standard out to a file called p450s_hmmsearch_dmel.txt.

When this command executes, nothing is printed, and instead our file is created. When using the > redirect, the file will be overwritten if it already exists. If, instead, we wished to append to an existing file (or create a new file if there is no file to append to), we could have used the >> redirect.
Here are the contents of our final analysis, a simple text file with quite a bit of information, including some nicely formatted row and column data, as displayed by less -S p450s_hmmsearch_dmel.txt.
