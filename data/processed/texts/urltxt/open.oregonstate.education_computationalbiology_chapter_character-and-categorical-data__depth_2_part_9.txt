ally associated with character vectors are not shown.

It is illustrating to attempt to use the str() and class() and attr() functions to dig into how factors are stored. Are they lists, like the results of the t.test() function, or something else? Unfortunately, they are relatively immune to the str() function; str(treatment_factor) reports:

This result illustrates that the data appear to be coded as integers. If we were to run print(class(treatment_factor)), we would discover its class is "factor".

As it turns out, the class of a data type is stored as an attribute.

Above, we learned that we could remove an attribute by setting it to NULL. Let’s set the "class" attribute to NULL, and then run str() on it.

Aha! This operation reveals a factor’s true nature: an integer vector, with an attribute of "levels" storing a character vector of labels, and an attribute for "class" that specifies the class of the vector as a factor. The data itself are stored as either 1 or 2, but the levels attribute has "chemical" as its first element (and hence an integer of 1 encodes "chemical") and "control" as its second (so 2 encodes "control").

This special "class" attribute controls how functions like str() and print() operate on an object, and if we want to change it, this is better done by using the class() accessor function rather than the attr() function as above. Let’s change the class back to factor.
