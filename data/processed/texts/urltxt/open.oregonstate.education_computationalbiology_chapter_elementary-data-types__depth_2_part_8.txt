to remember that the centromere_region variable is associated with part of string chr1 references. This is why seqd in the figure above does not duplicate data from seqc.

None of this discussion is to imply that you should worry about the computational efficiency of these operations at this point. Rather, the concept of immutability and the definition of a variable (in Python) as a “name that refers to some data” are important enough to warrant formal discussion.
