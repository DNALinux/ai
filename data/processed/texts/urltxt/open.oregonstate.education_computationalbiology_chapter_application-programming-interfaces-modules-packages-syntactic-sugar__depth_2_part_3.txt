refers, especially for looking up the API for objects of that type. The type() function comes in handy when combined with a print() call—it prints the type (the class) of data referenced by a variable. The result can then be investigated with help().

Modules
Consider this chunk of code from the example in chapter 23, “Objects and Classes,” which makes use of the Chromosome and SNP class definitions:

This segment of code takes a file name and produces a dictionary with nicely organized contents of the file. Because this functionality is succinctly defined, it makes sense to turn this into a function that takes the file name as a parameter and returns the dictionary. The code is almost exactly the same, except for being wrapped up in a function definition.

Later, we can call this function to do all the work of parsing a given file name:

Now, what if this function and the two class definitions were things that we wanted to use in other projects? We may wish to make a module out of them—a file containing Python code (usually related to a single topic, such as a set of functions or class definitions related to a particular kind of data or processing).
