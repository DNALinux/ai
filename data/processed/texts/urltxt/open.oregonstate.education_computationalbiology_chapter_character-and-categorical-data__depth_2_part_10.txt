an easily change the names of the levels by modifying the attribute. We can do this with the attr() function, but as usual, a specific accessor function called levels() is preferred.

Why is the levels() function preferred over using attr()? Because when using attr(), there would be nothing to stop us from doing something irresponsible, like setting the levels to identical values, as in c("Water", "Water"). The levels() function will check for this and other absurdities.

What the levels() function canâ€™t check for, however, is the semantic meaning of the levels themselves. It would not be a good idea to mix up the names, so that "Chemical" would actually be referring to plants treated with water, and vice versa:

The reason this is a bad idea is that using levels() only modifies the "levels" attribute but does nothing to the underlying integer data, breaking the mapping.
