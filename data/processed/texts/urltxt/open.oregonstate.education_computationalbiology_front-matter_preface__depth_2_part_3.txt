a quick online search, I find that no other commercial software supports my data, either. But I stumble upon a recent paper in a major bioinformatics journal describing not only a novel statistical methodology appropriate for the data, but also software available for download! Sadly, the software is designed for use on the Linux command line, with which I’m not familiar.

Realizing my quandary, I head to the local computing guru in the next lab over and explain the situation. Enthusiastically, she invites me to sit with her and take a look at the data. After uploading the data to the remote machine she regularly works on, she opens a hacker’s-style terminal interface, a black background with light gray text occasionally dotted with color. Without even installing the bioinformatics software, she begins giving me an overview of the data in seconds. “Very nice! Looks like you’ve got about 600 million sequences here . . . pretty good-quality scores, too.” After a few more keystrokes, she says, “And it looks like the library prep worked well; about 94% of these begin with the expected sequence bases. The others are probably error, but that’s normal.”
