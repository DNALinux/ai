u can calculate the answer by hand (or some other trusted process). When you know from testing that your program or even just parts of your program produces the intended output, hidden bugs are much less likely to slip through the cracks. Some people produce several small inputs that represent the variety of different input situations, run the tests, and compare the outputs to the expected results in an automated fashion. This is known as “unit testing,” a common practice in professional software development.
Finally, remember that every programmer, no matter her experience level, gets frustrated from time to time! This is entirely normal, and a good strategy when this happens is to take a brief walk, or even take a break for the day, picking up again the next day. Some find they program efficiently in the morning, others late at night. Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to program by trial and error, mindlessly tweaking the code in the hopes that it will produce the output you want. Even if you succeed this way (which rarely happens), you’re likely to produce code with insidious bugs, and it may well be unreadable even to yourself in a few days’ time.

Exercises

Write a Python program to compute the sample standard deviation of the E values in the file pz_blastx_yeast_top1.txt. As a reminder, the sample standard deviation is defined as the square root of the sum of squared differences from the mean, divided by the number of values minus 1:
