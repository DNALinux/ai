values) to replace all elements of a vector greater than the mean with 0 easily, no matter the order of the elements!

More often, we’ll want to extract such values using logical selection.

These sorts of vectorized selections, especially when combined with logical vectors, are a powerful and important part of R, so study them until you are confident with the technique.

Exercises
Do the same again, but modify the code to extract every third element of r into a vector called r_every_third.

Common Vector Functions
As vectors (specifically numeric vectors) are so ubiquitous, R has dozens (hundreds, actually) of functions that do useful things with them. While we can’t cover all of them, we can quickly cover a few that will be important in future chapters.

First, we’ve already seen the seq() and length() functions; the former generates a numeric vector comprising a sequence of numbers, and the latter returns the length of a vector as a single-element integer vector.

Presented without an example, mean(), sd(), and median() return the mean, standard deviation, and median of a numeric vector, respectively. (Provided that none of the input elements are NA, though all three accept the na.rm = TRUE parameter.) Generalizing median(), the quantile() function returns the Yth percentile of a function, or multiple percentiles if the second argument has more than one element.

The output is a named numeric vector:
