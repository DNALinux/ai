ed in determining the most SNP-dense region of each chromosome. There are a number of ways we could define SNP density, but we’ll choose an easy one: given a region from positions l to m, the density is the number of SNPs occurring within l and m divided by the size of the region, m – l + 1, times 1,000 (for SNPs per 1,000 base pairs).

For a Chromosome object to be able to tell us the highest-density region, it will need to be able to compute the density for any given region by counting the SNPs in that region. We can start by adding to the chromosome class a method that computes the SNP density between two positions l and m.

After debugging this method and ensuring it works, we can write a method that finds the highest-density region. But how should we define our regions? Let’s say we want to consider regions of 100,000 bases. Then we might consider bases 1 to 100,000 to be a region, 100,001 to 200,000 to be a region, and so on, up until the start of the region considered is past the last SNP location. We can accomplish this with a while-loop. The strategy will be to keep information on the densest region found so far (including its density as well as start and end location), and update this answer as needed in the loop.[8]
