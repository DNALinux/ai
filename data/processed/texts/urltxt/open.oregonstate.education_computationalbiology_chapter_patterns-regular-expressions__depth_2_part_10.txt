“doubled” words ([A-Za-z]+) \1 with a single copy of the word \1, as in I like sed very very much, resulting in I like sed very much. But beware if you are thinking of using substitution of this kind as a grammar checker, because this syntax does not search across line boundaries (although more complex sed programs can). This example would not modify the following pair of lines (where the word the appears twice):

A few final notes about sed and regular expressions in general will help conclude this chapter.

Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
