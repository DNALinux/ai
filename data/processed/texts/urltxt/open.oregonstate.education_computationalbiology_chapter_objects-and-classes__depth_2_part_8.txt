and sort a list of them. You might also try implementing a __repr__() method, which should return a string representing the object, enabling print() (as in print(geneA)).

Counting SNPs
As it turns out, multiple classes can be defined that interact with each other: instance variables of a custom class may refer to custom object types. Consider the file trio.subset.vcf, a VCF (variant call format) file for describing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced “snips”) across individuals in a group or population. In this case, the file represents a random sampling of SNPs from three people—a mother, a father, and their daughter—compared to the reference human genome.[6]

This file contains a variety of information, including header lines starting with # describing some of the coding found in the file. Columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent the chromosome number of the SNP, the SNP’s position on the chromosome, the ID of the SNP (if it has previously been described in human populations), the base present in the reference at that position, and an alternative base found in one of the three family members, respectively. Other columns describe various information; this file follows the “VCF 4.0” format, which is described in more detail at http://www.1000genomes.org/node/101. Some columns contain a . entry, which indicates that the information isn’t present; in the case of the ID column, these represent novel polymorphisms identified in this trio.
