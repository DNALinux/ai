ant. This table, stored in a file called contig_stats.txt, summarizes sequence statistics from a de novo genome assembly. Each row represents a “contig” from the assembly (a single sequence meant to represent a contiguous piece of the genome sequence produced from many overlapping sequenced pieces).

Each contig has an Average_coverage value, representing the average number of sequence reads covering each base in the assembled contig. These values can vary widely, potentially because of duplicated regions of the genome that were erroneously assembled into a single contig. The Consensus_length column indicates the length of the contig (in base pairs), and the gccontent column shows the percentage of G or C bases of the contig.

Let’s produce a dotplot for this data with Average_coverage on the x axis and Consensus_length on the y.

The result isn’t very good. There are outliers on both axes, preventing us from seeing any trends in the data. Let’s adjust the x scale by adding a scale_x_continuous(), setting name = to fix up the name of the scale, and using limits = to set the limits of the scale to c(0, 1000). We’ll also use the corresponding scale_y_continuous() to set a proper name for the y axis. (For discrete scales, such as in the boxplot example above, the corresponding functions are scale_x_discrete() and scale_y_discrete().)
