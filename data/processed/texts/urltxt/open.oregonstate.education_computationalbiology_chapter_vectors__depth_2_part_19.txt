home/username/rproject") in Unix/Linux and setwd("C:/Documents and Settings/username/My Documents/rproject") in Windows. It is also possible to specify file names by absolute path, as in /home/username/rproject/states.txt, no matter the present working directory. ↵If you have any familiarity with R, you might have run across the attach() function, which takes a data frame and results in the creation of a separate vector for each column. Generally, “disassembling” a data frame this way is a bad idea—after all, the columns of a data frame are usually associated with each other for a reason! Further, this function results in the creation of many variables with names based on the column names of the data frame. Because these names aren’t clearly delimited in the code, it’s easy to create hard-to-find bugs and mix up columns from multiple data frames this way. ↵There are also more specialized functions for both reading and writing tabular data, such as read.csv() and write.csv(). We’ve focused on read.table() and write.table() because they are flexible enough to read and write tables in a variety of formats, including comma separated, tab separated, and so on. ↵
