Exercises

Suppose we have any odd-length numeric vector (e.g., sample<- c(3.2, 5.1, 2.5, 1.6, 7.9) or sample <- runif(25, min = 0, max = 1)). Write some lines of code that result in printing the median of the vector, without using the median() or quantile() functions. You might find the length() and as.integer() functions to be helpful.
If sample is a sample from an exponential distribution, for example, sample <- rexp(1000, rate = 1.5), then the median of the sample is generally smaller than the mean. Generate a vector, between_median_mean, that contains all values of sample that are larger than (or equal to) the median of the sample, and less than (or equal to) the mean of the sample.
Read in the states.txt file into a data frame as described. Extract a numeric vector called murder_lowincome containing murder rates for just those states with per capita incomes less than the median per capita income (you can use the median() function this time). Similarly, extract a vector called murder_highincome containing murder rates for just those states with greater than (or equal to) the median per capita income. Run a two-sample t.test() to determine whether the mean murder rates are different between these two groups.
