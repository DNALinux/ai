d not be included because it is divisible by 6, but 34 should be because it is divisible by neither.)


Common Vector Functions
As vectors (specifically numeric vectors) are so ubiquitous, R has dozens (hundreds, actually) of functions that do useful things with them. While we can’t cover all of them, we can quickly cover a few that will be important in future chapters.
First, we’ve already seen the seq() and length() functions; the former generates a numeric vector comprising a sequence of numbers, and the latter returns the length of a vector as a single-element integer vector.

Presented without an example, mean(), sd(), and median() return the mean, standard deviation, and median of a numeric vector, respectively. (Provided that none of the input elements are NA, though all three accept the na.rm = TRUE parameter.) Generalizing median(), the quantile() function returns the Yth percentile of a function, or multiple percentiles if the second argument has more than one element.

The output is a named numeric vector:

The unique() function removes duplicates in a vector, leaving the remaining elements in order of their first occurrence, and the rev() function reverses a vector.
