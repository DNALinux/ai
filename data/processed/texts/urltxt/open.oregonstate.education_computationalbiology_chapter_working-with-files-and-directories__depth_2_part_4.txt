the original is not removed as part of the operation. The command for copying is cp, and the syntax is cp <source_path> <destination_path>. There is one caveat, however: cp will not copy an entire directory and all of its contents unless you add the -r flag to the command to indicate the operation should be recursive.

Forgetting the -r when attempting to copy a directory results in an omitting directory warning.

It is possible to simultaneously copy and move (and remove, etc.) many files by specifying multiple sources. For example, instead of cp ../todo_list.txt ., we could have copied both the to-do list and the p450s.fasta file with the same command:

Remove (Delete) a File or Directory
Files may be deleted with the rm command, as in rm <target_file>. If you wish to remove an entire directory and everything inside, you need to specify the -r flag for recursive, as in rm -r <target_dir>. Depending on the configuration of your system, you may be asked “are you sure?” for each file, to which you can reply with a y. To avoid this checking, you can also specify the -f (force) flag, as in rm -r -f <target_dir> or rm -rf <target_dir>. Let’s create a temporary directory alongside the file copies from above, inside the projects folder, and then remove the p450s.fasta file and the todo_list.txt file as well as the temporary folder.
