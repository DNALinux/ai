pattern unit: will do. Because grep prints its results to standard output, we will need to redirect the modified output to a file called, perhaps, pz_stats.table to indicate its tabular nature.

This time, less -S pz_stats.table reveals only the desired lines.

Rather than viewing the file with less, we can also count the number of lines present in the file with the wc tool, which counts the number of lines, words, and characters of input: wc <file>.

Working with the cleaned data table reveals that our program produced 21,131 characters broken into 3,297 words among 471 lines of data output.

This sort of command-line-driven analysis can be quite powerful, particularly because many of these programs—like less, grep, and wc—can both print their results on standard output and read input from standard input rather than from a file. Standard input is the secondary input mechanism for command-line programs (other than reading from files directly). By default, standard input, or “stdin,” is unused.

How can we get input to a program on its standard input? It turns out that the easiest way to do so is to redirect the standard output of another program to it using the |, also known as the “pipe,” redirect (found above the Enter key on most keyboards). In this case, the data come in “on the left”:
