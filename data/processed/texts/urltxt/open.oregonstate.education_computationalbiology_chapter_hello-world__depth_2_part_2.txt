removed from the hardware on which it was being coded. This meant writing “bytecode”—or its human-readable equivalent, assembly code—that explicitly referenced memory (RAM) locations and copied data to and from the relatively small number of CPU registers (the storage units directly accessible by the CPU). Unfortunately, this meant that code had to be rewritten for each of the many types of CPUs. Later, more portable languages like C were developed. These languages still work close to the hardware in many ways; in particular, the programmer must tell the computer how it should allocate and de-allocate memory from RAM. On the other hand, some abstraction provides higher-level coding constructs that are not specific to CPU type. This code is then compiled into bytecode by a compiling program for each specific CPU (as discussed in previous chapters, we had to compile some software from source to install it). The result is a fast and often optimized program that frees the programmer from having to worry about the huge variety of CPU types.
