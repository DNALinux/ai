of the fact that range() can take a step argument, as in range(start, stop, step). )

Exercises
Your code should still work if the substring occurs at the start or end of the sequence, or if the subsequence occurs back to back (e.g., in "GATACCGATAGATA", "GATA" occurs at positions 1, 7, and 11). As a hint, you may assume the subsequence is not self-overlapping (e.g., you needn’t worry about locating "GAGA" in "GAGAGAGAGA", which would occur at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7).

This problem is a bit tricky, but it will help you organize your thoughts around loops and lists. You might start by first determining the number of rows in the data, and then building the “structure” of rows as a list of empty lists.
