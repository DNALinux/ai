to be run by that program. Because in this case the interpreting program is bash, we can specify any commands that we can send to our shell, bash. Later, we’ll see that we can create scripts that use much more sophisticated interpreters, like python, to run more sophisticated code.

According to our execution rule, we can also run our program by specifying a relative path to it, like ./myprog.sh (which specifies to run the myprog.sh file found in the present working directory).

This is the most common way to run files and programs that exist in the present working directory.

If we change to another present working directory, like our home directory, then in order to run the program according to the execution rule, we have to again specify either the absolute or relative path.

This process is tedious; we’d like to be able to specify the name of the program, but because the location of our program isn’t specified in a directory listed in $PATH, we’ll get an error.

Installing a Program
To add our own programs to the system so that we can run them at will from any location, we need to:

Traditionally, the location to store one’s own personal executables is in one’s home directory, inside a directory called local, inside a directory called bin. Let’s create these directories (creating them was also part of a previous exercise, so you may not need to), and move our myprog.sh file there.
