most of the functionality in a slimmed-down version they called UNICS—this time short for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service—a play on the Multics name but not denoting a major difference in structure. As work progressed, the operating system was renamed Unix. Further developments allowed the software to be easily translated (or ported) for use on computer hardware of different types. These early versions of Multics and Unix also pioneered the automatic and simultaneous sharing of hardware resources (such as CPU time) between users, as well as protected files belonging to one user from others—important features when many researchers must share a single machine. (These same features allow us to multitask on modern desktop computers.)

During this time, AT&T and its subsidiary Bell Labs were prohibited by antitrust legislation from commercializing any projects not directly related to telephony. As such, the researchers licensed, free of cost, copies of the Unix software to any interested parties. The combination of a robust technology, easy portability, and free cost ensured that there were a large number of interested users, particularly in academia. Before long, many applications were written to operate on top of the Unix framework (many of which we’ll use in this book), representing a powerful computing environment even before the 1980s.
