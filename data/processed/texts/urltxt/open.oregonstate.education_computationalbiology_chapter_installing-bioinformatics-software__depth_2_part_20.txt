nd so on. We can thus further generalize our script:

We could have replaced all instances of $query with $1, but this organization makes our script easier to read in the future, an important consideration when programming. Now we can run a full analysis by specifying the three relevant file names on the command line, as in: ./runhmmer.sh p450s.fasta dmel-all-translation-r6.02.fasta p450s_hmmsearch_dmel.txt.
This runhmmer.sh is a good candidate for inclusion in our $HOME/local/bin so that we can run it from anywhere, though we may want to add lines immediately following the #! line, to provide some help text for anyone who attempts to run the script without providing the correct inputs:

The “if block” above will only execute if the number of parameters given ($#) is not equal to 3. Although languages like Python provide much nicer facilities for this sort of logic-based execution, the ability to conditionally provide usage information for scripts is important. As usual for bash, the interpreter ignores lines that start with #.

Exercises

Create a new folder in your projects folder called c_elegans. Locate the FASTA file for the reference genome of Caenorhabditis elegans from http://wormbase.org, and download it to this folder using wget. The file you are searching for will be named something like c_elegans.PRJNA13758.WS244.genomic.fa.gz. After it is downloaded, decompress it and view it with less -S.
