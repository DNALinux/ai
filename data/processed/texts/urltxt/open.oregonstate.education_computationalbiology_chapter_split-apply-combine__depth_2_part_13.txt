ommonly misunderstood features of R.

Functions Are Everywhere
Although mostly hidden from view, most (if not all) operations in R are actually function calls. Sometimes function names might contain nonalphanumeric characters. In these cases, we can enclose the function name in backticks, as in iqr1 <- `ipercentile_range`(samples$s1). (In chapter 27, “Variables and Data,” we learned that any variable name can be enclosed in backticks this way, though it’s rarely recommended.)

What about something like the lowly addition operator, +? It works much like a function: given two inputs (left-hand-side and right-hand-side vectors), it returns an output (the element-by-element sum).

In fact, + really is a function that takes two parameters, but to call it that way we need to use backticks.

This might be considered somewhat amazing—the “human-readable” version is converted into a corresponding function call behind the scenes by the interpreter. The latter, functional representation is easier for the interpreter to make use of than the human-friendly representation. This is an example of syntactic sugar: adjustments to a language that make it “sweeter” for human programmers. R contains quite a lot of syntactic sugar. Even the assignment operator <- is a function call! The line a <- c(1, 2, 3) is actually syntactic sugar for `<-`("a", c(1, 2, 3)).
