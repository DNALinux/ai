ined and reasonable way to do so.[1] Because some programming languages are faster than others—but only by a constant factor (perhaps compiled C code is 100 times faster than Python)—a good algorithm implemented in a slow language often beats a mediocre algorithm implemented in a fast language!

Now, a run time of  isn’t very good: the time taken to sort a list of numbers will grow quadratically with the size of the list.

isn’t great, but for the sorting problem we can do better, and we’ll return to the study of algorithms and sorting a bit later. First, let’s detour and talk about interesting ways we can organize data, using variables and the objects to which they refer.

Data Structures
A data structure is an organization for a collection of data that ideally allows for fast access and certain operations on the data. We’ve seen a couple of data structures already in Python: lists and dictionaries. Given such a structure, we might ask questions like:
