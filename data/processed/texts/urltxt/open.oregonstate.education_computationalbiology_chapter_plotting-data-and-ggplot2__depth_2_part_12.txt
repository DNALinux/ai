te data, and ggplot2 will handle the data with grace. Further, we can specify the data as mathematical expressions of the columns in the input data frame (or even other data), as we did with color = price/carat. Doing so allows us to explore data sets in a powerful and flexible way. We could quickly discretize the price per carat by setting color = price/carat > 5000, for example, or we could reduce the range of these values by plotting with color = log(price/carat). In the subsection on scales, however, we’ll see that ggplot2 contains some friendly features for plotting data on log-adjusted and similar scales.

Because this plot is far too busy, let’s fix it by removing the alpha and size mapping, remembering the possibility of a relationship between cut and depth for future exploration. We’ll also add a layer for a smoothed fit line.
