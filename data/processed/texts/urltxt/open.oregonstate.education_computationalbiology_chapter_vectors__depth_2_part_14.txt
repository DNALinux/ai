e interpreter that the first line in the file gives the column names (without it, the column names will be "V1", "V2", "V3" and so on). The sep = "\t" parameter indicates that tab characters are used to separate the columns in the file (the default is any whitespace), and comment.char = "#" indicates that # characters and anything after them should be ignored while reading the file (which is appropriate, as evident by the # mitten annotation in the file). The stringsAsFactors = FALSE parameter is more cryptic: it tells the interpreter to leave the character-vector columns (like region in this example) as character vectors, rather than convert them to the more sophisticated factor data type (to be covered in later chapters).
At this point, the states variable contains the data frame holding the columns (vectors) of data. We can print it with print(states), but the result is quite a lot of output:

It might make better sense to extract just the first 10 rows of data and print them, which we can do with the head() function (head() can also extract just the first few elements of a long vector).

The functions nrow() and ncol() return the number of rows and columns of a data frame, respectively (which is preferred over length(), which returns the number of columns); the dim() function returns a two-element vector with number of rows (at index 1) and number of columns (at index 2).
