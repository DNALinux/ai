r of buttons, four of which are worth discussing immediately. First, the save button (the small blue diskette) saves the fileâ€”R script files traditionally get the file extension .R. Farther to the right, the Run button sends the highlighted section of code to the interpreter window, even if that section is multiple lines (which are executed by the interpreter in sequence, as with most languages). The next button (with the loopy blue arrow) reruns the most recently run section of code, even if it is not highlighted. Finally, the Source button runs all the code in the file, just as would the Rscript version on the command line. The outputs of Run and Source are shown in the interpreter pane below, in black text.
