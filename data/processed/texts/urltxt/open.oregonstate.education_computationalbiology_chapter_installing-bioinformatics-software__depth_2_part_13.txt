the sequence may be broken, or how long those lines should be. After the last sequence line for a record, a new sequence record may start.
Depending on the source of the FASTA file, the IDs or metadata may represent multiple pieces of data; in this example, the metadata are separated by spaces and have a <label>=<value>; format that is specific to protein sequences from FlyBase.
For our next trick, we’ll download some P450-1A1 protein sequences from Uniprot.org. Uniprot.org is a well-known protein database, and it is composed of the “TrEMBL” database and the subset of TrEMBL, known as “Swiss-Prot.” While the former contains many sequences with annotations, many of those annotations have been assigned by automated homology searches and have not been reviewed. The latter, Swiss-Prot, contains only sequences whose annotations have been manually reviewed.
For the download, we’ll enter “p450 1A1” into the search field, and we’ll filter the results to only those in Swiss-Prot by clicking on the “Reviewed” link, resulting in 28 matches. Next, we can click on the “Download” button to download a “FASTA (canonical)” (rather than with all isoforms included) file.

The Uniprot website recently underwent a redesign, such that the downloaded file is transferred directly to the web browser, rather than presented as a URL that could be accessed with wget. This isn’t a problem, as it gives us a chance to discuss how to transfer files between the remote system and local desktop via SFTP.
