a File
In chapter 17, “Conditional Control Flow,” one of the exercises involved computing the molecular weight for each sequence in a tab-separated file of IDs and sequences, ids_seqs.txt. Here are the lines of this file viewed with less -S:

If you completed the molecular weight exercise in chapter 17, you might have found it somewhat challenging. Without using functions, you likely needed to use a for-loop to iterate over each line of the file, and within there another for-loop to iterate over each base of the current sequence, and inside of that an if-statement to determine the molecular weight of each base.

Here we’ll write a similar program, except this time we’ll make use of a function that returns the GC content of its parameter. The entire solution is actually quite short and readable.

In the above code (ids_seqs_gcs.py), there’s a clear “separation of concerns” that makes designing a solution easier. One function handles counting bases in a DNA sequence, and another the computation of the GC content. With those out of the way, we can turn our focus to parsing the input file and printing the output.

To simplify exposition, most of the small code samples in the next few chapters don’t involve creating new functions. Most of the exercises will suggest writing functions as a means of breaking a problem down into its component parts, however.
