The reluctance operator can also follow the asterisk and curly brackets, but beware: when used without following one of these three repetition operators, the question mark operator works as an “optional” operator (e.g., r"C(ATG)?C" matches "CC" and "CATGC").
The second major difference between Python (Perl-style) regular expressions and POSIX-extended regular expressions is in how they specify character classes. As mentioned above, a pattern like r"[A-Za-z0-9_]" is shorthand for “any alphanumeric and the underscore,” so a series of alphanumerics can be matched with r"[A-Za-z0-9_]+". In POSIX regular expressions, the character class A-Za-z0-9_ can be specified with [:alnum:], and the pattern would then need to be used like [[:alnum:]]+ in sed.
