colleague has left her R session open, so we decide to redefine + to mean “to the power of”:

Ok, maybe that’s a bit too evil. Another feature of R is that function names that begin and end with % and take two parameters signals that the function can be used as an infix function via syntactic sugar.

Sugary Data Frame Split-Apply-Combine
Although the basic units of data in R are vectors, and lists are used to store heterogeneous data, data frames are important as a storage mechanism for tabular data. Because lapply() can apply a function to each element of a list, it can also apply a function to each column of a data frame. This fact can be used, for example, to extract all numeric columns from a data frame with an application of lapply() and is.numeric() (the latter returns TRUE when its input is a numeric type; we’ll leave the details as an exercise).

For most tabular data, though, we aren’t interested in independently applying a function to each column. Rather, we more often wish to apply a function to different sets of rows grouped by one or more of the columns. (This is exactly what we want to do with the sub_df_to_pvals() function we wrote for our gene expression analysis.) The dplyr package (install.packages("dplyr")) provides this ability and is both powerful and easy to use, once we get used to its specialized syntactic sugar.
