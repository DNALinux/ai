puter running the SSH login system uses a unique pair of “keys” for cryptographic purposes: the public key is accessible to the world, and only the remote computer knows the private key. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key—if you cared to verify with the owner of the remote computer that the public key “fingerprint” was correct, then you could be assured that no one between you and the correct remote computer could see your login session. Unless you have a reason to suspect espionage of some sort, it’s usually safe to enter yes at this prompt. Normally, you will be prompted once for each fingerprint, unless your local computer forgets the fingerprint or the system administrator changes it (or there is indeed an espionage attempt!).

In any case, you will next be asked to enter your password. Note that as you type the password, you won’t see any characters being shown on the screen. This is another security feature, so that no passersby can see the contents or even the length of your password. It does make password entry more difficult, however, so take care when entering it. After logging in to a remote computer, the command prompt will usually change to reflect the login:

If you are running Microsoft Windows, you will need to download the client SSH software from the web, install it, and run it. One option is PuTTy.exe, which is available at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.
