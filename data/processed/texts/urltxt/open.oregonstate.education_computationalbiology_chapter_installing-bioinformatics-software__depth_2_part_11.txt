Getting Data
Now that we’ve got the software installed for our example analysis, we’ll need to get some data. Supposing we don’t have any novel data to work with, we’ll ask the following question: can we identify, using HMMER and muscle, homologues of P450-1A1 genes in the Drosophila melanogaster protein data set? (This is a useless example, as the D. melanogaster genome is already well annotated.)
The first step will be to download the D. melanogaster data set, which we can find on http://flybase.org, the genome repository for Drosophila genomes. Generally, genome repositories like FlyBase provide full data sets for download, but they can be difficult to find. To start, we’ll navigate to “Files,” then “Releases (FTP).”

From there, we’ll navigate to a recent release, like FB2014_05. Because genomic information is often being updated as better information becomes available, newer versions are indicated by newer releases.

Next we’ll see links for specific species; we’ll work with dmel_r6.02. It is often a good idea to note specific release numbers or release dates for data sets you download, for eventual description in the methods sections of any papers you write that are based on those data.
