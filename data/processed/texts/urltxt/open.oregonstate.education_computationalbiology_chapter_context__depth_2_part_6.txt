vironment under a license similar to that of BSD Unix. (GNU stands for GNU’s Not Unix: a recursive, self-referencing acronym exemplifying the peculiar humor of computer scientists.)

The GNU project implemented a licensing scheme that differed somewhat from the BSD license. GNU software was to be licensed under terms created specifically for the project, called the GPL, or GNU Public License. The GPL allows anyone to use the software in any way they see fit (including distributing for free or selling any program built using it), provided they also make available the human-readable code that they’ve created and license it under the GPL as well (the essence of “open source”[1]). It’s as if the Ford Motor Company gave away the blueprints for a new car, with the requirement that any car designed using those blueprints also come with its own blueprints and similar rules. For this reason, software written under the GPL has a natural tendency to spread and grow. Ironically and ingeniously, Richard Stallmann and the BSD group used the licensing system, generally intended to protect the spread of intellectual property and causing the Unix crisis of the 1980s, to ensure the perpetual freedom of their work (and with it, the Unix legacy).
