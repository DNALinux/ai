cial locations relative to the directory they are contained in. The . directory is a shortcut for the same directory it is contained in. Colloquially, it means “here.” The .. directory is a shortcut for the directory above the directory containing it. Colloquially, it means “up.”

Every directory has these “virtual” links, and they can be used as relative paths themselves or in relative or absolute paths. Here, for example, we can cd . to stay where we are, or cd .. to go up one directory:

If we like, we can go up two directories with cd ../..:

We can even use . and .. in longer relative or absolute paths (number 2 in the figure below illustrates the relatively odd path of /media/./cdrom0, which is identical to /media/cdrom0).
