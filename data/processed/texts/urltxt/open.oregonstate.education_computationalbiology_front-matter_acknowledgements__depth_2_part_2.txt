work–in particular, Brett Tyler, Tom Booth, Faye Chadwell, Dianna Fisher, and Mark Kindred from those departments. I am grateful to all those who contributed feedback including Matthew Peterson, Kevin Weitemier, Andi Stephens, Kelly Stratton, Jason Williams, John Gamble, Kasim Alomari, Joshua Petitmermet, and Katie Carter. Finally, I especially thank Gabriel Higginbotham for his heroic work in typesetting, and to Stacey Wagner for her comprehensive and insightful comments.
