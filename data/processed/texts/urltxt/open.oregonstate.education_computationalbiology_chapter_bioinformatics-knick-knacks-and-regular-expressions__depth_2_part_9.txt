In the code above, we’ve replaced the split on "\t" that we’re used to with a re.split() on r"\s+", which will ensure that we correctly parse the pieces of the line even if they are separated with multiple tabs, spaces, or some combination thereof.
Counting Promoter Elements
Consider the file grape_promoters.txt, which contains on each line 1000bp upstream of gene regions in the Vitis vinifera genome:

These columns are not separated by a tab character, but rather by a variable number of spaces.
Promoter motifs are small DNA patterns nearby gene sequences to which the cellular machinery binds in order to help initiate the gene-transcription process. For example, the ABF protein binds to the DNA pattern "CACGTGGC" if it is near a gene in some plants. Some motifs are flexible and can be described by regular expressions; the GATA protein binds to any short DNA sequence matching the pattern "[AT]GATA[GA]". We wish to analyze the V. vinifera upstream regions above, and count for each the number of occurrences of the GATA motif. Our output should look like so:
