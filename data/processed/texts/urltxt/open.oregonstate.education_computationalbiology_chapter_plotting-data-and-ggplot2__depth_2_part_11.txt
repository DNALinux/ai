deserves some special attention, not only because scatterplots are a particularly useful plot type for data exploration, but also because we can use it to illustrate more features of the ggplot2 package. Unfortunately, scatterplots tend to suffer from “overplotting” issues when the number of data points is large, as in previous examples. For now, we’ll get around this issue by generating a random subset of 1,000 diamonds for plotting, placing the sample in a data frame called dd.

First, the geom_point() layer accepts a number of aesthetics that might be useful in other situations as well.

The result is probably too many aesthetics to map to values from the data, but sometimes for exploratory purposes (rather than publication), this isn’t a bad thing. In this plot we can see a few interesting features of the data. (1) Diamonds are usually cut to carat sizes that are round numbers (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, etc.). (2) The price per carat (mapped to color) is generally higher for larger diamonds. This means that not only are larger diamonds more expensive, but they are also more expensive on a per carat basis (they are rarer, after all). (3) Although it’s a bit difficult to see in this plot, it appears that points with the best cut (mapped to alpha, or “transparency”) are also of intermediate depth (mapped to the y axis). Or, at the very least, outliers in depth tend to have poorer “cut” values.
