alone has forced biologists to routinely aggregate multi-gigabyte data sets and compare the results against multi-terabyte databases. The good news is that work of this kind is within the reach of anyone possessing the right computational skills.

The purpose of this book is perhaps best illustrated by a fictional, but not unreasonable, scenario. Suppose I am a life scientist (undergraduate or graduate research assistant, postdoc, or faculty) with limited but basic computational skills. I’ve identified a recently developed data collection method—perhaps a new sequencing technology—that promises to provide unique insight into my system of study. After considerable field and lab work, the data are returned as a dozen files a few gigabytes in total size.

Knowing this data set is too large for any web-based tool like those hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), I head to my local sequencing center, which conveniently hosts a copy of the latest graphical suite for bioinformatics analysis. After clicking through the menus and panes, searching the toolbox window, and looking at the help manual, I come to realize this software suite cannot process this newly generated data. Because the software is governed by an expensive license agreement, I send an email to the company and receive a prompt reply. It seems the development team is working on a feature for the type of analysis I want, but they don’t expect it to be ready until next year’s release.
