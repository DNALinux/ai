ng these pieces, we can put together a regular expression that serves as a simple (and not actually useful in practice) open reading frame finder. For prokaryotic sequences (where introns are not a consideration), we’ll define these as a start codon ATG, followed by one or more codons, followed by one of the three canonical stop codons TAA, TAG, or TGA. The pattern for the start is ATG, and we’ve seen how we can encode a stop above, with ((TAA)|(TAG)|(TGA)). How about “one or more codons?” Well, “one or more” is embodied in the + operator, and a codon is any three A’s, T’s, C’s, or G’s. So, “one or more codons” is encoded as ([ACTG]{3,3})+. Thus the regular expression for our simple open reading frame finder is:

In reality, regular expressions are not often used in searching for coding regions (though they are sometimes used for identifying smaller motifs). Part of the reason is that regular expressions are, by default, greedy: they match the first occurring pattern they can, and they seek to match as much of the string as they can. (The cellular machinery that processes open reading frames is not greedy in this way.) Consider the following sequence, which has three open reading frames according to our simple definition and regular expression above.
