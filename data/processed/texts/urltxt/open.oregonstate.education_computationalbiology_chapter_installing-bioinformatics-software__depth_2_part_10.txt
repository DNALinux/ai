possible.

The uname program gives information about the operating system, which in this case appears to be GNU/Linux for a 64-bit, x86 CPU. If any of the binaries are likely to work, it will be the “i86linux64” set. We’ll wget that gzipped tarball in the downloads directory.

Note that in this case we haven’t used the -O option for wget, because the file name described by the URL (muscle3.8.31_i86linux64.tar.gz) is what we would like to call the file when it is downloaded anyway. Continuing on to unpack it, we find it contains only an executable that we can attempt to run.

Because it didn’t report an execution error, we can install it by copying it to our $HOME/local/bin directory. While doing so, we’ll give it a simpler name, muscle.

Now our multiple aligner, muscle, is installed!

Exercises

Follow the steps above to install the HMMER suite (from source) as well as muscle (from binaries) in your $HOME/local/bin directory. Ensure that you can run them from anywhere (including from your home directory) by running muscle --help and hmmsearch --help. Both commands should display help text instead of an error. Further, check that the versions being found by the shell are from your home directory by running which hmmsearch and which muscle.
Determine whether you have the “NCBI Blast+” tools installed by searching for the blastn program. If they are installed, where are they located? If they are not installed, find them and install them from binaries.
