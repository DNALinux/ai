specified the "smooth" stat. As a consequence, the underlying data representing carat and price were modified by the stat, and the stat knew which variables to smooth on the basis of this aesthetic mapping.

For a second example, let’s look at the "bin" stat and the "bar" geom, which together create a histogram. The "bin" stat checks the x aesthetic mapping to determine which column to bin into discrete counts, and also creates some entirely new columns in the stat-transformed data, including one called ..count... The extra dots indicate to the user that the column produced by the stat is novel. The "bar" geom pays attention to the x aesthetic (to determine each bar’s location on the horizontal axis) and the y aesthetic (to determine each bar’s height).

The result of plotting the above is shown below on the left. To complete the example, below on the right shows the same plot with geom = "point". We can easily see that the stat-transformed data contain only about 30 rows, with columns for bin centers (carat mapped on x) and counts (..count..). The "bin" stat also generates a ..density.. column you can explore.
