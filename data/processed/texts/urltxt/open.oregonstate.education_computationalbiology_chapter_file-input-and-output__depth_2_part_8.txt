actual code for our program. When executed, it reliably prints Mean is: 1.37212611293e-08.

Note that the actual Python code (in blast_mean.py) ended up looking quite a lot like the pseudocode—this is one of the frequently cited selling points for Python. (For this reason, we’ll also skip the pseudocode step for most examples in this book, though it can still be a valuable technique when programming in any language.)
This may seem like a fair amount of work to compute a simple mean, but it is a consequence of writing software “from scratch,” and we have to start somewhere! Additionally, the benefit of learning these techniques will pay off over the long run when it comes to solving novel problems.
The Process of Programming
Although the process of designing a strategy (and pseudocode) seems tedious, it’s highly recommended. As you progress in your abilities, your strategies and pseudocode will become more terse and higher level, but you should never skip the planning steps before coding. (On the other hand, there is also the danger of over-planning, but this more often effects teams of coders working on large projects.)
