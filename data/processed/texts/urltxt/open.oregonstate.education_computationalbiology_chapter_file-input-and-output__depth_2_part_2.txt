xist in an external file (a text file, usually) using a file handle, a special kind of data type we can connect to using an external source. In its simplest form, a file handle for reading data works sort of like a pipe: the operating system puts data (usually strings) in one end, and we extract data out of the other end, usually one line at a time. File handles for writing to files move the data in the opposite direction.
