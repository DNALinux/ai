is instance, it can be useful for URLs whose ending file names aren’t reasonable (like index.php?query=fasta&search=drosophila).

At this point, we have a file ending in .tar.gz, known as a “gzipped tarball,” representing a collection of files that have first been combined into a single file (a tarball), and then compressed (with the gzip utility).

To get the contents out, we have to reverse this process. First, we’ll un-gzip the file with gzip -d hmmer-3.1b1.tar.gz, which will replace the file with the un-gzipped hmmer-3.1b1.tar.[3] From there, we can un-tar the tarball with tar -xf hmmer-3.1b1.tar (the -x indicates extract, and the f indicates that the data will be extracted from the specified file name).

It looks like the gzipped tarball contained a directory, called hmmer-3.1b1.

Other Download and Compression Methods
Before continuing to work with the downloaded source code, there are a couple of things to note regarding compressed files and downloading. First, although gzipped tarballs are the most commonly used compression format for Unix-like systems, other compression types may also be found. They can usually be identified by the file extension. Different tools are available for each type, though there is also a generic uncompress utility that can handle most common types.
