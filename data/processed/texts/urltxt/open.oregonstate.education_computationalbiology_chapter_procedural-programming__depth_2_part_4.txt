ctures like while-loops in interesting ways. R excels at generating random data from a given distribution; for example, rnorm(1000, mean = 20, sd = 10) returns a 100-element numeric vector with values sampled from a normal distribution with mean 20 and standard deviation 10.

Although we’ll cover plotting in more detail later, the hist() function allows us to produce a basic histogram from a numeric vector. (Doing so requires a graphical interface like Rstudio for easily displaying the output. See chapter 37, “Plotting Data and ggplot2,” for details on plotting in R.)

What if we wanted to sample numbers originally from this distribution, but limited to the range 0 to 30? One way to do this is by “resampling” any values that fall outside of this range. This will effectively truncate the distribution at these values, producing a new distribution with altered mean and standard deviation. (These sorts of “truncated by resampling” distributions are sometimes needed for simulation purposes.)

Ideally, we’d like a function that encapsulates this idea, so we can say sample <- rnorm_trunc(0, 30, 1000, mean = 20, sd = 10). We’ll start by defining our function, and inside the function we’ll first produce an initial sample.

Note the usage of mean = mean in the call to rnorm(). The right-hand side refers to the parameter passed to the rnorm_trunc() function, the left-hand side refers to the parameter taken by rnorm(), and the interpreter has no problem with this usage.
