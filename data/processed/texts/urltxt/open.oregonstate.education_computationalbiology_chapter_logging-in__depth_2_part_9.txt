ating system “image” should be loaded onto the virtual machine. All users can create such images—some users create images with software preinstalled to analyze RNA sequencing data, perform de novo genome assembly, and so on. We’ve created an image specifically to accompany this book: it is fairly simple and includes NCBI Blast+ (the most modern version of BLAST produced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information), R, Python, git, and a few other tools. It is called “APCB Image.”

To activate a new instance with this image, click on the “New -> Instance” button in the Atmosphere interface. You may first need to create a “Project” for the instance to live in. You can search for “APCB Image” in the search box of instance types. Here’s the view of my APCB project after creating and starting the instance:

After creating the instance, it may be in one of several states; usually it will be either “running” (i.e., available for login and consuming resources) or “suspended” (effectively paused and not consuming resources). The interface for a given instance has buttons for suspending or resuming a suspended instance, as well as buttons for “Stop” (shutting an instance down), “Reboot” (rebooting the instance), and “Delete” (removing the instance and all data stored in it).
