er and visual clue that these variables are intended to be used outside of the nested if-blocks, and that we should check their contents before using them later.

C++ and other block-level-scoped languages thus encourage “short-lived” variables, which is a good programming mantra. Defining variables only when needed and using them for as short a time as possible helps to produce clearer, more modular, and even more efficient code (because short-lived variables allow the garbage collector to clean out more data). In a way, breaking Rule 1 of functions is a similar type of abuse of variable scope.

Beginning programmers often find it easier to avoid these conventions by setting a large number of variables near the beginning of a program and then accessing and setting them at various points throughout the program. This is sometimes colloquially called “spaghetti code,” because the long-distance connections created between the different areas of code resemble spaghetti. Rarely does this strategy pay off, however.

As discussed in chapter 25, “Algorithms and Data Structures,” local variables and similar concepts allow us to solve complex problems in fascinating and elegant ways.
