only one gene is identified as having a significant interaction after BY correction in this analysis. (If 100 were returned, we would expect 5 of them to be false positives due to the 0.05 FDR cutoff used.)

For grouped data frames, print() will omit printing some columns if they donâ€™t fit in the display window. To see all the columns (including our new interaction_BY column), we can convert the grouped table back into a regular data frame and print the head() of it with print(head(data.frame(pvals_interaction_sig))). For the curious, the interaction_BY value of this ID is 0.048.

Exercises

We spent a fair amount of work ensuring that the data frame generated and returned by sub_df_to_pvals_df() was programmatically generated. Take advantage of this fact by making the formula a secondary parameter of the function, that is, as function(sub_df, form), so that within the function the linear model can be produced as lm1 <- lm(form, data = sub_df).Next, run the analysis with group_by() and do(), but specify some other formula in the do() call (perhaps something like expression ~ genotype + treatment + tissue).
