then one column might represent whether the measured value was from a “male” or “female,” or from the “control” group or “treatment” group. Sometimes these categories, while not numeric, have an intrinsic order, like “low,” “medium,” and “high” dosages.

Sadly, more often than not, these entries are not encoded for easy analysis. Consider the tab-separated file expr_long_coded.txt, where each line represents an (normalized) expression reading for a gene (specified by the ID column) in a given sample group. This experiment tested the effects of a chemical treatment on an agricultural plant species. The sample group encodes information about what genotype was tested (either C6 or L4), the treatment applied to the plants (either control or chemical), the tissue type measured (either A, B, or C for leaf, stem, or root), and numbers for statistical replicates (1, 2, or 3).

Initially, we’ll read the table into a data frame. For this set of data, we’ll likely want to work with the categorical information independently, for example, by extracting only values for the chemical treatment. This would be much easier if the data frame had individual columns for genotype, treatment, tissue, and replicate as opposed to a single, all-encompassing sample column.
