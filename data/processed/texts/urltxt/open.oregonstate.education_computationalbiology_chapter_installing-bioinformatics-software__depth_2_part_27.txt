la). The client discussed here is called FireFTP, and it is available as an extension for the Mozilla Firefox web browser (itself available for Windows, OS X, and Linux). To get it requires installing and running Firefox, navigating to Tools → Addons, and searching for “FireFTP.”

Once the plugin is installed (which requires a restart of Firefox), we can access it from the Tools → Developer submenu. Connecting the client to a remote computer requires that we first configure the connection by selecting “Create an account.” The basic required information includes an account name, the host to connect to (e.g., an IP address like 128.196.64.120 or a host name like files.institution.edu), as well as our login name and password.

We also need to tell the client which protocol to connect with, which is done on the “Connection” tab; we want SFTP on port 22.
