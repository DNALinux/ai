d with a project, and provide hints and documentation during the programming process. Many IDEs (like Eclipse and Xcode) are complicated pieces of software in their own right. The RStudio IDE is moderately complex, but the developers have worked hard to focus on ease of use specifically for the R programming language. It is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux, at http://rstudio.com. Installing RStudio requires first installing the R interpreter from http://www.r-project.org.

When first opened, RStudio presents three panes. On the left is the same interface with the interpreter that we saw by running R on the command line. On the lower right is a pane presenting tabs for a file browser, a help browser, and a panel where plots can be viewed. The upper right pane shows the history of commands that the interpreter has run since it opened and the “global environment,” illustrating some information about which variables and data the interpreter currently has stored in memory.

None of these three panes, however, is the one we are primarily interested in! To open up the most important pane, we need to create a new “R script” file—a text file of R commands, just like the executable script on the command line. To do this, we use the button with a green plus sign.

The new pane is an editor for our code file. Here we’ve entered three lines of code (a line like #!/usr/bin/env Rstudio is only necessary for running R scripts on the command line).
