to create the database, we use the makeblastdb tool:

This will create a list of files in the databases folder. These are all part
of the blast database.

Blast
We can now blast our sequences against the database. In this case, both our
query sequences and database sequences are DNA sequences, so we use the
blastn tool:

You can use different output formats with the outmft option:

Blast with parallel
If you need to run your blasts faster (and who doesn't?), you can maximise
CPU usage with gnu parallel. You will find it at this
link.

Download the archive, extract it (with tar xvfB parallel-latest.tar.bz2) and
install it with the following commands:

We can now use parallel to speed up blast:

More options and getting help
If you need help to know the options and parameters you can pass blastn and
the other blast+ utilities, use the --help option and pipe the output into
less, for example:

NCBI blast tools cover more cases than DNA against DNA searches. For example,
you can search a protein database with either DNA or protein sequences. Here is
an exhaustive list of the programs that come with the blast+ distribution:
