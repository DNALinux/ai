archive. For example:

Add the bin folder from the extracted archive to your path. For example, add
the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

And change the /PATH/TO part to the path where you have put the extracted
archive.

Example sequences to use with the tutorial
In order to test blast, you need a test fasta file. Use the following files
that come with the tutorial:

Create blast database
The different blast tools require a formatted database to search against. In
order to create the database, we use the makeblastdb tool:

This will create a list of files in the databases folder. These are all part
of the blast database.

Blast
We can now blast our sequences against the database. In this case, both our
query sequences and database sequences are DNA sequences, so we use the
blastn tool:

You can use different output formats with the outmft option:

Blast with parallel
If you need to run your blasts faster (and who doesn't?), you can maximise
CPU usage with gnu parallel. You will
